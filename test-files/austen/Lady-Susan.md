# Lady Susan (Pierpont Morgan Library, NY)

**Objective**: encode the relationship between the manuscripts as linguistic structures (words, phrases, etc.) and as physical support (notebook)

### General characteristics of material
- novela of letters, originally written into bound quarto notebook
- documentary encoding
- virtual reunification of Austen's holograph manuscripts 
	- conservation history
	- material state

### Capture with encoding
- Austen's particularities of spelling, paragraphing, punctuation, etc.; defined in the metadata and referenced in the text:
	- long ```S``` (unicode?)
	- ampersand ```&```
	- hyphenation ```::``` or ```-```, etc.
	- dashes (long, short, very long)
	- underlined text
	- quotes and quotation marks
	- distinct spelling
	- abbreviation
- structure of text: 
	- two hierarchies: physical structure of document and narratological structure of text. Which data in which hierarchy?
	- front/body/back
	- line- and page breaks 
	- paragraphs
	- indentation (four different indentations in _Lady Susan_: short-indent, indent, indent1, indent2)
	- page containing two letters
- hand shifts (person who writes and instrument of writing), rewritings, deletions and additions
- hyphenation in insertions, to make sure that they correspond with the linebreaks in the original/deleted part
