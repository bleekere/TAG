            assembled in a folder, essentially a sheet of paper folded
            once with its edges stitched for reinforcement. The folder
            is about the same size as the manuscript booklet and leaves.
            It is not known who prepared it; however, wording on the
            folder’s front leaf (recto and verso) is in Melville’s hand.
            Prominently inscribed on the front cover is a large,
            carefully drafted numeral 3, which suggests that the folder
            may have been the third of several such folders containing

            Inscribed above the numeral are the words, “First Draught of
            ‘Typee’ — After which much was added &amp; altered,”
            which clearly indicate that the manuscript text was
            significantly augmented and revised, beyond the insertions
            and deletions visible in manuscript, to create the text that
            was published in the first British edition. Below this
            inscription and to the right of the numeral is the added
            wording, “Written in the Spring of 1845 — Began in New York
            in the winter of that year &amp; finished in
            Lansingburgh in the early part of the summer.” This series
            of phrases is written in increasingly smaller script. The
            observation that the writing began in New York City suggests
            that Melville may have used the residences and offices of
            his brothers, Gansevoort and Allan. And according to the
            final phrase, the final draft was completed in early summer
            at his family home in Lansingburgh, NY. Each line of
            information may have been added at different times; however,
            a precise sequencing of the text cannot be determined.</p>

          <p>Scribbling on the inside front cover of the folder reveals
            an important late phase of Melville’s creative process
            regarding the respelling of his characters’ names.
            Throughout the original manuscript inscription, Melville
            uses an orthography that seems to attempt to be faithful to
            Polynesian pronunciation. However, at some later point,
            either as he was preparing his fair copy or after that fair
            copy was sent to England, he westernized the spellings and
            pronunciations of Polynesian characters and places. For
            instance, the original “Faaua” became “Fayaway” (see
            RS12ms56e71). In the case of the inside cover scribbling, we
            find Melville tinkering with the spelling of the name of
            Fayaway’s father, originally called “Maheyo.” Because the
            inscribed names and false starts (“Mar” and “Mh”) appear on
            separate lines, it is not certain in what order Melville
            composed them, or even if these false starts preceded the
            writing of all or any of the fully inscribed names. The
            false start “Mh” indicates that Melville might have
            considered a compression of the name’s opening sound, giving
            us (perhaps) something like “M’heyo.” However, Melville
            eventually settled for the more conventional New England
            sound as evident in the false start “Mar.” The first two,
            fully inscribed, names ring changes on alternative
            pronunciations. “Marheyoo” suggests the sounds “hey you”;
            “Marheeyo” evokes something of a donkey’s bray. Both
            reinforce the broader humors of the doddering old man’s
            comic character. The third full inscription and the one
            Melville finally accepted, “Marheyo,” gives a “heigh-o”
            ending to the name that suggests a more gentrified and
            amiable sensibility.</p>

            the verandah” [2], which in a later proofreading phase he

            “of the natives” breaks the parallelism with “group of
            gossiping idlers.” HM may have cut this phrase in fair copy
            before submitting to Murray to westernize the scene. Or, an

            proofreading phase he thought better of “lustily” and
            changed it to “in the most animated manner” [2]. Probably at
            this same time he also inserted “all the while” above
            “looking on” [3] in order to stress the concurrence of
            activities. Since HM supplied no caret, the
            phrase's intended position in the sentence is just
            a guess. In the pencil substage, HM or Gansevoort underlined
            “with one another” in pencil [4] possibly to indicate that
            the phrase is a bit redundant in light of “all the while.”
            HM may have then returned to the manuscript and decided

          <p>Gansevoort's light pencil underlining of “with one

            an editorial revision made either by HM in fair copy or by
            Murray's copyeditor or Gansevoort later on in

          <p>HM is revising probably while copying. He first writes “a

            with the idea of finishing the phrase with something like
            “door of a village tavern.” Instead, he cancels “door of”
            and continues on with “tavern door of a village” [2].
            Recognizing either immediately or in a later proofreading
            phase that this repeats “village” in “village idlers,” he
            cancels the first “village,” inserting “gossiping” to give
            “gossiping idlers”[3]. Also in the later pencil substage
            Gansevoort placed penciled dots in the margins and numbered
            the words “door,” “village,” and “tavern” with 1, 2, and 3,
            respectively, to indicate a final revision to “door of a

        <div id="RN10e3" synch="RS10ms3e3" type="narr">
          <p>HM did not finalize the suggested revision until the
            fair-copy stage [5]. At this time he made two other changes.
            First, the matter of “gossiping idlers.” Initially in step
            3, HM had added “gossiping” perhaps as part of his general
            attempt here and elsewhere to westernize the natives by
            depicting them in terms of amiable Irvingesque village life.
            But it also seems that HM felt he had gone too far in that
            direction, and he removed “gossiping,” recognizing that his
            “idlers” need not be gossips in this scene. Second, the
            conversion of the long “like” phrase into a main clause
            creates better pacing and marshalling of detail; and the use
            of “reminded” is in keeping with HM's references
            elsewhere to recollection. However, the impersonality of
            “one” in “They reminded one” is overly formalized and
            atypical of HM's other recollection statements. It
            is possible, then, that HM revised the phrase into something
            like “They reminded me” but that an editor revised “reminded
            me” to “reminded one.”</p>

          <p>HM may have canceled “taking his” as soon as he inscribed
            it, thus revising his text while copying it. If so, he may
            have had “his taking his departure” [step A1] in mind, but
            in mid-thought shifted to simply “his departure” [A2].
            However, the crosshatch cancellation marks are more typical
            of changes made in later proofreading phases, so it is more
            likely that HM first wrote “his taking his departure” [B1]
            and upon returning to his text simply canceled the seemingly
            redundant “taking his” to give “previous to his departure”
            [B2].</p>

          <p>The manuscript word eventually deleted and not appearing in the British edition appears to be “striking” and was printed as such in the initial (2006) version of the present edition.  However, Hershel Parker reads the word as “stripling,” and a search of “-ling” endings and other appearances of “striking” in the edition supports that reading.  The word was changed to “stripling” in 2009.</p>
          <p>The removal in print of “stripling” from “young girls
            &amp; stripling boys” [step 1] turns a sexually
            charged phrase into the merely routine “young girls
            &amp; boys” [2]. The <hi rend="italics">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> defines “stripling” as “A youth, one just passing from boyhood to manhood.”
            On the heels of the preceding adverbial
            clause concerning Tommo's clasping his arms around
            Kory-Kory, the idea of pubescent “stripling” boys might have pushed the
            homosociality of Tommo's male bonding too close to
            a homosexual yearning for youth and beauty. The removal of
            the word, perhaps in the fair-copy stage, would therefore
            fit the theory that HM was altering his text to make
            Tommo's heterosexual orientation more clearly
            pronounced. However, the deletion may have occurred during
            the preparation of the English edition, in which case
            Gansevoort or a British editor equally sensitive to the

            his attempt to remove the repetitious sound of “in
            infinite.” Then, too, “in glee” is a nonstandard usage, and
            HM or an editor preparing the English edition might have

            trial run on an alternative phrasing: “Kory-Kory waded …,

            may have been triggered when he reached “carried” one line
            down. The “gaining …, wading …, carried” structure was
            retained in the first English edition, even though it is a

          <p>Sometime during or after the fair-copy stage [3], HM
            expanded the bathing scene, adding significantly more
            sexually charged material (burning cheeks, bashful timidity,
            and blushes that need cooling). He also has Tommo wash
            “myself down to the waist” rather than just his face. The
            effect is to dramatize Tommo's feelings of
            embarrassment at this crucial moment of initial undressing.
            It is also evidence of HM's conscious
            transformation of a remembered moment into a sensual
            awakening, an expansion upon his own as well as his
            character's sexual self-awareness. But apparently
            this sensual expansion was too much for editor John Wiley.
            In the American Revised edition the passage is reduced, but
            not restored to its original MS state. The burning cheeks,
            timidity, and cooled blushes are removed [4]; however, Tommo
            continues to bathe himself in front of the “female portion”
            to the waist rather than simply wash his face (as HM had him
            do in the original version of the passage). In this one
            revision site, then, we see HM's early intention to
            merely transcribe a memory transformed into a sensual

            either by HM in fair copy or by Gansevoort or
            Murray's editor in the preparation of the English
            edition.</p>

        <div id="RN10ms14e13" synch="RS10ms14e13" type="narr">
          <p>HM tinkered with this clause considerably in several
            proofreading phases. He initially wrote “From the smooth
            surfaces of the rocks that lay strewn around, the natives
            had now slide [sic] off into the water …” [step 1]. The
            principal shift from past perfect tense “had now slid” to
            past progressive “were now sliding” marks a significant
            shift in narrative tone [2]. In the previous paragraph, HM
            has treated the events in the simple past tense. Moving to
            the past perfect simply indicates that the natives had gone
            about their business while Kory-Kory began bathing Tommo.
            However, the subsequent revision to present progressive
            creates a more immediate sense of action. The insertion of
            “verdant” stressing the greenness of the rocks [3] is
            probably coordinated with insertions appearing a few lines
            earlier: “grass grown rocks” (RS10ms9) and later “green
            mossy rocks,” “sea weed covered,” and “mossy” (RS10ms17).
            The other two revisions are relatively minor reworkings of
            words. The shift from “rocks” to “large stones” [4]
            corresponds to the reverse shift in RS10ms9. HM also plays
            around with “strewn” and “scattered.” He begins with “strewn
            around,” tries out “scattered around” [5], and then decides
            on “scattered about” [6].</p>

          <p>Rather than creating a compound adjective with “smooth

            substitute “verdant” for “smooth,” but failed in MS to
            cancel “smooth.” HM may have corrected this oversight in his

          <p>HM cancels the “y” in “they” and squeezes “ir” at the end
            to form “their.” There are at least three explanations for
            this alteration. HM may have simply miswritten “they” for
            “their,” and later upon proofreading corrected it. Another,
            more remote, possibility is that HM intended “they” as a
            repetition of his subject “young gerls” which he immediately
            followed with more modifiers in parallel until he reached
            the common predicate “looked like.” That is, “The young
            gerls[,] springing buoyantly …” and “they[,] eyes sparkling
            …” would be in parallel. If this is the case, HM
            nevertheless felt the repeated subject to be unnecessary
            (not to mention grammatically overextended) and revised
            “they” to “their,” creating a longer, uninterrupted flow of
            modifiers between one unrepeated subject and its predicate.
            A third, more likely, explanation is that HM initially
            intended to get on with his clause (with something like
            “they looked like mermaids”) but immediately thought of the
            sparkling eyes modifier, and adjusted “they” to “their” so
            that he could expand the description.</p>

          <p>Initially, HM wrote that the “young gerls … looked like so
            many mermaids sporting in the billows that washed the sides
            of their treacherous lurking places” [step 1]. A doodle
            indicates that he stopped writing for a spell, perhaps to
            puzzle over the imagery of this passage, or simply to call
            it a day. In any event, upon returning to the manuscript, he
            revised the scene a good deal. As it stood, the line
            contained something of an ambiguity. It seems clear that in
            using the words “their treacherous lurking places,” HM
            intended to refer to those hidden rocky places where
            mermaids lurk in order to lure sailors to their death. But
            the phrasing also has a double entendre, giving the
            alternative impression that “lurking places” refers to areas
            of the female anatomy. We cannot tell if the desire to
            modify or eliminate this apparently inadvertent sexual
            aspect of an already sensual image motivated HM's
            revisions, but the effect of the changes in fact enhances as
            well the sensuality of the imagery.</p>
          <p>HM's general strategy is to distance the girls
            from the mermaid imagery that defines them by emphasizing
            their placement on slippery river rocks (covered with moss)
            as opposed to the mermaids' ocean habitat and its
            “sea weed covered” rocks. But the trigger for those changes
            may have been the shift from “treacherous” to “mossy” [2].
            Here, HM is toning down the ominousness of the sexual
            association, but the image is faulty, for moss <hi rend="italics">per se</hi> does not grow on sea rocks.
            Even so, this triggers the fuller and more accurate
            alignment of river versus sea: HM inserts “among those green
            mossy rocks” for the girls [3] and then “sea weed covered”
            [4] to define the sides of the mermaids' “lurking
            places.” (See also RS10ms9 and 14 and RS10e6.) But he does
            not then cancel the redundant “mossy” used to define
            “places.” Since HM is meticulous elsewhere in eliminating
            such redundancies, we might conclude that he was done with
            this passage. As it now stands, the image, while more
            careful in its separation of the girls from the mermaids, is
            even more sensual than before with its “mossy lurking
            places.” In reflecting upon his revisions, HM may have at
            this time created his wavy line doodle filling up most of
            the blank space to the right. Does the doodle depict ocean
            waves, or mermaid's hips? Perhaps HM was just
            letting out ink before leaving off for the day.</p>

            The false start “About noon of this same day” [step 1]

            placing the coming events “During the latter part of the
            afternoon of this same day” [2]. In the pencil substage,
            someone, HM or perhaps Gansevoort placed a dot in the left

            to “and removed that objection” [4]. The former MS phrasing

          <p>Initially, HM planned to continue his description of

            a coordinate clause beginning with either “and” or “and so,”
            but he finally decided upon the solo conjunction “so.” It is
            possible that “and” is a false start for “and so” [step A1],
            in which case HM canceled “and” the moment he wrote it,
            opted for “so,” and continued on [A2]. Or, he may have

            and later canceled the superfluous “and” during a
            proofreading phase [B2]. Chances are the latter scenario
            holds: in composing while copying HM tended to adopt a more
            casual phrasing, like “and so,” typical of oral

          <p>HM's initial idea (as expressed in the preceding
            sentence) seems to have been to use the winding nature of
            the path as an example of the islanders' indolence.
            That is, the path is not level or direct because the lazy
            pathmakers prefer to go around impediments rather than
            remove them. However, HM's description of
            one's exertion in walking the route seems to
            counter his notion of native indolence by suggesting that
            the Typees must work quite hard to travel the road. As it
            stands here in MS and in print, the paragraph comes to no
            final resolution about what the structure of the path
            reveals concerning Typeean character. But the revisions
            here, like the change of “savages” to “islanders” in the
            previous paragraph (RS10ms25), reflect HM's
            evolution toward a less critical stance on native custom.</p>
          <p>HM began with the intention of writing a statement that
            flatly attests to a contradiction: the path is well-beaten
            like a wilderness trail but difficult to travel. He first
            writes “The path was obviously the most beaten one in the
            valley, several others leading from either side into it yet
            despite these circumstances it was” [step 1]. HM stops
            himself at this point, probably with the idea of stressing
            his observation of the island contradiction with something
            like “yet despite these circumstances it was as difficult to
            travel as the recesses of a wilderness.” HM seems
            to want to suggest that the well-beaten “circumstances” of
            the roads exist despite their impediments. But he interrupts
            the thought, canceling “despite these circumstances it was,”
            first deleting “it was” (with the idea perhaps of continuing
            with “it seemed”) but then striking out “despite these
            circumstances” as well (with an entirely new thought in
            mind). Here, HM finds himself at one of the many junctures
            in which the creative process both jogs his memory and
            insists upon narrative manipulation. In writing, he realizes
            that over time, even during his limited stay in Taipivai,
            and as he had walked the trail repeatedly, its
            circuitousness had become less of a nuisance. Thus, he
            replaces his “despite” phrase with “until I grew more
            familiar with its impediments, it seemed as difficult to
            travel as the recesses of a wilderness” [2]. But adding this
            notion of his growing familiarly with the trail may have
            less to do with HM's recollection than with his
            desire to establish with his readers that Tommo has spent
            enough time in Typee to learn the trail. In a later
            proofreading phase, he inserted the additional clause
            “&amp; perhaps for successive generations it had formed
            the principal avenue of the place” [3] by squeezing a caret
            and ampersand just before the “yet” of his “yet until”
            clause. This expansion stresses the antiquity of Typeean
            culture, and suggests a further attempt to temper his
            earlier view of Typeean indolence.</p>

            with RS10ms28, HM revised “with their summits often hidden”
            to “whose summits were often hidden” [3]. However,
            HM's most immediate concern seems to be the need to
            eliminate the assonance of “projecting masses of moss
            covered rocks.” He may have also wanted to reduce the
            redundancy of “moss,” a word that appears in one version or
            another on this MS page. It is possible, then, that in the
            pencil substage [4], HM or Gansevoort sensed this problem
            and placed a dot in the margin next to this line to indicate
            the need for further revision. Later, HM returned to his
            text and revised “moss covered” to “columnar” [5], which
            removes the redundant “moss” and adds a new descriptive
            feature of the Marquesan terrain. But while “columnar rocks”
            (i.e., dramatically vertical formations) can be found on
            Nuku Hiva, the implied verticality of the phrase seems to
            contradict the horizontal implications of “projecting
            masses.”</p>

            inadvertently writing “occasing” for “occasionally” [step
            1]. In a set of proofreading phases, he probably first
            revised “glade” to “glen” [2] to eliminate the redundancy
            with “depths of a glade.” At this same moment but with a
            different structural concern in mind, he also added the
            ampersand as part of his attempt to stress the parallelism
            of “one moment climbing” and “then descending” [3]. Along
            this same line, he converted the long sentence into two by
            canceling the ampersand in “&amp; pursued the depths”

            canceling “enormous branches” in two strokes and inserting
            “vast forest antlers that shot horizontally through the air”

          <p>The alterations at this site are characteristic of the
            jockeying of terms HM performs to achieve a more restrained
            but still-present gothicism. Revising as he writes, HM
            initially inscribes “It was the sacred grove of the valley —
            the scene of many a sensual feast, of many a horid rite.
            Beneath the shadows of the consecrated Breadfruit trees
            there reigned a perpetual twilight, a cathedral gloom that
            hung over the place &amp; bathed every object” [step 1].
            However, as soon as he abandons his subordinate <hi rend="italics">that</hi>-clause in the second sentence, HM
            transforms and expands the image of gloom “bathing every
            object” to one of silence brooding and breathing over the
            scene. To do this, he crosses out “that hung over the place
            &amp; bathed every object” as soon as he writes it, and
            continues with a new sentence: “The horrid genius of the
            pagan worship seemed to brood in silence over the place
            breathing its spells upon every object around” [2]. This new
            image dissipates the impact of gloom and supplements it with
            the deeper elements of “genius” and “silence.”</p>
          <p>Either at this time or at a later proofreading phase, HM
            noted the repetition of <hi rend="italics">horrid</hi> in
            “horid rite” and “horrid genius” and altered the second
            appearance of the adjective by canceling it and squeezing
            “sombre” at the end of the preceding line to give “sombre
            genius” [3]. In another proofreading phase, HM recast the
            opening of this paragraph in order to heighten the
            scene's lurid and gothic aspect. He canceled his
            original opening, “It was the sacred grove,” which
            introduces a certain religiosity, and replaced it with the
            less dramatic, more clinical opener “Here were situated the
            Tabu Groves,” which nevertheless announces the pagan notion
            of “taboo.” At this time, he might also have inserted “deep”
            to create the more intense image of “deep shadows” and
            altered “perpetual twilight” to “solemn twilight,” thus
            turning the tone back somewhat (but not entirely) to the
            sacred [4]. Quite possibly the insertion of “solemn”
            triggered the alteration of “sombre genius” to “frightful
            genius” in the following line, a shift that reemphasizes the
            gothic in counteraction to “solemn” [5]. In short, the
            revisions indicate a careful balance of the sacred and the
            lurid. Another later alteration is the shift from “Tabu” to
            “Taboo” [6], which HM performed by squeezing a double <hi rend="italics">o</hi> over the <hi rend="italics">u.</hi>
            This revision probably occurred late in the process when HM
            began modifying his Polynesian spelling (see RN10e27).
            Parker asserts that no other book gave as much currency to
            the “oo” spelling of “taboo” than <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> (361); however, HM may be following Porter in
            this spelling.</p>
          <p>In the pencil substage, HM or Gansevoort placed a dot in
            the margin to the right of “cathedral gloom” and inserted,
            also in pencil, the word “like” after “cathedral” to suggest
            a revision to “cathedral-like gloom” [7]. Apparently, the
            original elliptical wording of “cathedral gloom,” while
            appealing to our modern ear, offended the reigning
            sensibility of the day, either because of its marginal
            grammar or its hint of irreligiosity; however, HM did not
            add “like” in ink to the MS.</p>

            production stages [8]. HM may have revised “sensual feast”
            to the far less suggestive “prolonged feast” as well as
            “deep shadows” to “dark shadows” (RN10e32-33). The changes

            “rustic” found four lines earlier in the sentence (see
            RN10ms45). However, he opts to retain “rustic” so that the

          <p>HM first completes the long sentence describing the “alters

            edifices perhaps were putrefying the relics of some recent
            sacrifice” [step1]. In a proofreading phase, he canceled
            “edifices perhaps,” which removes the clarification of
            “edifices” but also eliminates the uncertainty of “perhaps”
            [2]. In a later phase, he removed the entire clause with two
            bold penstrokes and worked out new wording on separate
            pieces of paper. The clause appears on one such separate
            leaf, or insertion slip, found with the MS. Corresponding
            pinholes in both the insertion slip and Leaf 2 indicate that
            the slip was at one time attached to Leaf 2 with a straight
            pin. The writing on this slip is unusually legible,
            suggesting that the slip is a fair copy of revisions of the
            relative clause that he made on other, now-lost leaves. Even
            so, HM made two changes in the clause as he copied it onto
            the insertion slip. HM first inscribes “within which might
            be seen in various stages of decay offerings of fruit” but
            stops himself at “fruit” [3]. Either he has miscopied,
            supplying “fruit” for “bread fruit,” or decides to alter
            “fruit” to “bread fruit.” Canceling “fruit,” he continues
            with “bread fruit &amp; cocoa nuts and the putrefying
            relics of some blo” [4]. At this point he stops once again.
            By inscribing “blo” he has made a false start on “bloody
            sacrifice.” In this case he may have considered adding
            “bloody” and then rejected the new word, or he may have been
            in the process of copying and decided in mid-word to abandon
            it. In either event, he cancels “blo” and then completes the
            clause with “recent sacrifice” [5]. (For a British censoring
            of HM's use of “bloody,” see RS10e78.) The
            revisions to his insertion slip and the preceding lines (see
            RN10ms40-47) fine-tune the description of the Taboo Groves
            so that it is more graphic but less sensational. Here,
            however, we see that this complex operation comes
            experimentally. His last-second consideration of “bloody” is
            as impulsively rejected as it is entertained, and the final

          <p>If HM has merely been copying and revising as he copies on
            this leaf, that process breaks down when he reaches his
            description of the pipi and its relation to “the hallowed
            Holah Holah ground.” At this point, he begins composing
            fresh material. He considers writing a relative clause
            describing the Hoolah ground, but as he writes, he
            immediately shifts to a participial phrase. He first writes
            “the hallowed Holah Holah ground … which was” with the idea
            of saying something like “which was comprised of a pipi”
            [step 1], but he interrupts the thought, cancels “which
            was,” and continues with “comprising an extensive pipi
            flanked by two” [2]. The difficulty he has from this point
            on is finding the right wording to describe how the altars
            and bamboo sheds are arranged on the four sides of the pipi.
            He begins by focusing on the sheds and tries out several
            wordings, each successively canceled. The pipi is “flanked
            by two” sheds, or “surrounded on all sides by ranges” of
            sheds [3], or “shut in on two sides by ran{ges}” of sheds
            [4]. In the last iteration, HM interrupts himself in
            mid-word, inscribing only “ran” for “ranges” again, and then
            tries a new strategy by focusing on the altars at the “ends”
            of the pipi. His intended text is something like “…
            comprising an extensive pipi its ends occupied by altars”
            [5]. But he interrupts himself at “its ends” and tries yet
            another strategy. Canceling “its ends,” he continues with
            “terminating at either end in a lofty alter” [6]. In a later
            proofreading phase, he returned to this site and inserted
            “oblong,” which further defines the shape of the pipi, and
            “terraced,” which gives the more precise shape of a “lofty
            terraced alter” [7].</p>

            which he cancels [step 1]. He then thinks better of the
            cancellation, writing out “little” in full [2], but again he
            cancels the word, and continues on with “slight stagings of
            bamboo” [3]. HM may have also canceled “of bamboo” as he
            writes. His idea is to depict a small elevated platform
            pulpit attached to the tree trunk and fenced around with
            stalks of bamboo. Only the fencing and not the stage seems
            to be made of bamboo, and HM realizes this either
            immediately as he composes [4A] or later in proofreading
            [4B]. In either case, he canceled “of bamboo” to clarify the
            depiction; however, as the sentence stands in MS, the

            initially wrote “which condemned to instant death the

          <p>Here, and in the next revision site, HM attempts to
            describe the buildings of the Hoolah Hoolah ground, which,
            even in the first English edition, are not rendered with
            complete success. In all, he describes three buildings: the
            altar, priests' residence, and “Ti” (or
            bachelor's hall, as HM later calls it). But the
            exact positioning of these structures with relation to each
            other and to the entire ground remains unclear. The reason
            for this seems to be that HM's more precise
            remembrance of things occurred to him as he wrote, and he
            found himself revising in order to catch up with his memory,
            but in the process he simply left certain details less
            explained than others. The revision narrative of these two
            sites is a reasonable construction of what might have
            happened. As such, it provides a fascinating glimpse at the
            ways in which sentence structure, memory, and social values
            intermingle in Melville's attempt at seemingly
            simple description.</p>
          <p>The likely trigger for the revisions in both sites is the
            word “verandah” (see RS10ms61), which apparently brought to
            HM's mind the fact that he was attributing the
            wrong class of islanders to the wrong building. That is, he
            realized upon writing the word that he had mistakenly
            identified the priests' residence as the
            chiefs' habitation and that he must correct that
            error and also account for yet another building, the “Ti.”
            Stopping, then, at the word “verandah” in RS10ms61, he
            returned to the present revision site, RS10ms60.</p>
          <p>HM's final text does not come easily. Having
            already described the altar (RS10ms50-51), he needs in this
            sentence to describe a second structure. Initially his idea
            is to complete his sentence that begins “Access was had …
            through an embowered entrance … facing a numbered [sic] of
            towering cocoanut trees that at intervals were flanked along
            a level areas [sic] of a hundred yards” (RS10ms58) and ends
            with a concluding participial phrase that would say
            something like “terminating in an” edifice of some sort
            [step 1]. But recognizing perhaps that this repeats
            “terminating at” earlier on the manuscript page (see
            RN10ms50), he immediately cancels “terminating in an” and
            opts for an extended prepositional phrase: “at the extremity
            of which was an immense building reserved for the habitation
            of the great cheifs the religious attendants and the self
            styled Gods among” [2]. He pauses here, probably intending
            to continue with something like “among the inhabitants of
            the valley,” but immediately revises “among” to “of the
            valley” [3]. The entire phrase after this tinkering reads,
            “at the extremity of which was an immense building reserved
            for the habitation of the great cheifs the religious
            attendants and the self styled Gods of the valley.” As it
            stands, the participial phrase seriously overloads the
            sentence but nevertheless records HM's first
            recollection that chiefs, attendants, and self-styled gods
            cohabited in one building.</p>
          <p>[An alternative view is that HM canceled the words “great
            cheifs” as soon as he wrote them and substituted the words
            “the religious attendants &amp; self styled Gods” as he
            completed the participial phrase. This would mean that he
            was not grouping three classes together but recalled as he
            wrote that the chiefs were not involved. This would suggest
            that his confusion of chiefs and priests was clarified
            before he resolved his confusion about the separate
            buildings evident in his later insertion of the word
            “another” in the following revision site. HM probably did
            not revise this participial phrase into a sentence until
            later on, after he reached the word “verandah.” (For
            HM's final revisions to this passage, see
            RS10ms58). ]</p>
          <p>After finishing his participial phrase in the previous
            sentence, HM continued, still with the idea of describing
            only one building; he added a new sentence: “This remarkable
            edifice was built as usual upon the summit of a pipi,
            &amp; was at least two hundred feet in length,
            tho' not more than twenty in breadth.—” [4]. But in
            writing the following sentence (RS10ms61), HM recalls that
            he must speak of not one but two buildings side by side, and
            this triggers a series of revisions. This next sentence in
            its earliest version reads, “On one side &amp; along its
            whole extent ran a narrow verandah” [5]. At first, HM
            tinkered a bit, trying out “In front” as a replacement for
            “On one side” [6]. Then cogitating on “narrow verandah,” he
            realizes that the building for the chiefs (or Ti), which has
            the verandah, is in fact separate from the priests'
            dwelling. He cancels “narrow verandah” [7], then cancels the
            sentence [8], and begins to recast his entire description of
            the Hoolah Hoolah ground (stretching back to RS10ms50-51) so
            that it will have two buildings instead of one.</p>
          <p>To do this, he had to rethink the sentences found here and
            in RS10ms60; he needed a more forceful and balanced
            structure to describe the two separate buildings. In
            returning to RS10ms60 to reread the description, he came to
            the prepositional phrase (“at the extremity”) that he had
            used to introduce what he had thought was just one building,
            canceled it, and revised the remainder of the phrase into a
            complete sentence.</p>
          <p>This required a number of operations. He capitalized “at,”
            and altered “the extremity of which” to “the further
            extremity of this space.” He also revised “was an immense
            building” to “was situated a considerable building” [9].
            These structural revisions were accompanied by other more
            significant substantive changes: He canceled “great cheifs”
            (which resolves the confusion of priests and chiefs); he
            removed the derogatory “self styled Gods” (which eliminates
            its implication of false worship), he inserted “priests
            &amp;” in front of “religious attendants,” and he
            changed “valley” to “Grove” [10]. At this point, the new
            sentence reads: “At the further extremity of this space was
            situated a considerable building reserved for the habitation
            of the priests &amp; religious attendants of the Grove.”
            In recasting this sentence, he sharpened his memory and rid
            the description of its aspersions of native life in favor of
            a more anthropologically realistic notion of the islanders.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the second sentence in RS10ms60, HM completed
            his new, more accurate description by revising “This
            remarkable edifice was built as usual …” to “In its vicinity
            was another remarkable edifice built as usual. …” The
            insertion of “another” clarified the distinction between the
            priests' abode just described and the
            chief's abode (or Ti) with its distinguishing
            verandah, to come. This revision also meant HM had to doctor
            the compound predicate “&amp; was at least two hundred
            feet.” He considered changing it to the dependent clause
            “&amp; which was at least …” [11] but he cancels both
            “which” and “was” to end up with a simple phrase, “at least
            two hundred feet” [12]. The sentence at this point reads,
            “In its vicinity was another remarkable edifice built as
            usual upon the summit of a pipi, &amp; at least two
            hundred feet in length, tho' not more than twenty
            in breadth.”</p>
          <p>Having again reached RS10ms61 as he revised, HM next
            composed a new introduction for the “narrow verandah,” the
            image that initiated his revision. At first, he intends the
            sentence to begin with the preposition “In” [13], but he
            changes his mind as soon as he writes “In,” inscribes “The”
            over it, and continues on: “The whole front was completely
            open &amp; from one end to the other ran a narrow
            verandah fenced in on the edge of the pipi with a picket of
            canes” [14].</p>
          <p>Finally, at this point or perhaps in a later proofreading
            phase, HM inserted “of this latter structure” to designate
            the proper building [15], and tinkered with the first
            sentence in the passage by altering “was situated a
            considerable building” to “was to be seen a building of
            considerable size” [16]. (At this point, he may have fixed
            the problem of “numbered of towering cocoanut trees” in
            RS10ms59.)</p>
          <p>To clarify the distance traveled in the revision process,
            we can compare HM's final intentions for both the
            first and last versions of the entire passage describing the
            two buildings.</p>
          <p>HM's first version: “Access was had … through an
            embowered entrance … facing a numbered [sic; see RS10ms59]
            of towering cocoanut trees … flanked along a level areas
            [sic; RS10e41] of a hundred yards at the extremity of which
            was an immense building reserved for the habitation of the
            great cheifs the religious attendants &amp; the self
            styled Gods of the valley. This remarkable edifice was built
            as usual upon the summit of a pipi, &amp; was at least
            two hundred feet in length, tho' not more than
            twenty in breadth.— On one side &amp; along
            its' whole extent was a narrow verandah.”</p>
          <p>HM's revised version: “Access was had … through an
            embowered entrance … facing a numbered [sic] of towering
            cocoanut trees … flanked along a level areas [sic] of a
            hundred yards. At the further extremity of this space was to
            be seen a building of considerable size reserved for the
            habitation of the priests &amp; religious attendants of
            the Grove. In its vicinity was another remarkable edifice
            built as usual upon the summit of a pipi, &amp; at least
            two hundred feet in length, tho' not more than

            use of “laying” here [step 1] is typical. Probably the
            correction to “lying” was performed by an editor [2];
            however, the repetition of “layers of mats, laying between
            parallel trunks” may have urged HM, in the fair-copy stage,
            to alter the verb to “lie” on his own accord.</p>

          <p>HM begins a new sentence as if to continue his description
            of the interior of the Ti. It is not clear what he intended
            to describe, perhaps the group of ancient warriors or the
            native armory, both of which are discussed in subsequent
            paragraphs. (This latter option seems unlikely given that
            the “armory” paragraph was inserted much later in the
            process when HM was beginning in stage III to add new
            chapters to his work [see also RS10ms57].) Initially, he
            wrote “At one end was placed this” [step 1], but he
            immediately interrupted the gambit of further description
            for a sentence that would eventually name the building.
            Canceling these words, he continues, however, with a
            sentence that is merely denotative: “This was the building
            to which Mehevi now conducted us” [2]. In a proofreading
            phase that may have occurred fairly late in the process
            while he was adding his paragraph on the armory, HM inserted
            the name for the building: “denominated in the language of
            the native the ‘ti’” [3]. The word <hi rend="italics">ti</hi> itself does not appear in the Marquesan word books
            of the period, but <hi rend="italics">tai</hi> is a common

            resolve the problem of the misplaced <hi rend="italics">which-</hi> clause.” He, or perhaps an editor later on,

          <p>In moving from the discussion of female taboo in the “Ti”
            to this description of the old warriors, HM initially writes
            “On entering the house we were” [step 1]. Stopping here, he
            cancels “we were,” inscribes “Toby and myself” and finishes
            his sentence [2]. In a proofreading phase, probably after
            deciding to include the insertion discussed in RN10ms74-75
            (which also intensifies the “hideous” aspect of the old
            warriors), he revised to “five hideous old wretches on whose
            decrepid forms time &amp; tatooing seemed to have
            obliterated every trace of humanity” [3]. Since the
            tattooing covers the entire body, “forms” is more accurate
            than simply “backs.” The relative lightness of the inking of
            “&amp; tatooing” on the page suggests that this revision
            was made at a different time and in coordination with the
            cancellation of “of tatooing” in the next line (see
            RS10ms69-70). By adding “tattooing” to “time,” HM creates a
            more comprehensive introductory sentence to the description
            that follows. Some time later, probably in stage III while
            he was adding new chapters to his work based on personal
            experience, HM added an extended description of the
            natives' “armory” located in the “Ti.” In relating
            an instance of warfare witnessed by Tommo in chapter 17, HM
            mentions hearing gunshots and at that point in the
            compositional process he may have realized that he needed to
            establish the presence of musketry in the valley. It was
            probably at that time that he returned to this point in the
            MS and inserted his armory paragraph. To do this, he
            composed his description on a separate, now-lost sheet (or
            sheets) and attached a final version of his text to MS leaf
            5; he also placed an insertion device, a circle divided in
            quarters with four dots in each section, directly above the
            dash situated before “On entering the house” to indicate the
            proper placement of the new paragraph [4]. Because the
            insertion sheet has not been found, the text of this lost MS
            insertion slip can only be inferred from its finalized
            version appearing in the first English edition [5]. In the
            insertion process, HM also altered the opening sentence of
            the present paragraph so that it would follow smoothly from
            the newly inserted armory description. He canceled “On
            entering the house” because that is the opener for the
            armory paragraph, and he canceled “Toby and myself” because
            the armory description concludes with a reference to Toby.
            He then put an ink dot under the previously canceled “we” in
            order to restore it [6] to give “we were struck.”</p>

            tatooing, which only terminates among these islanders when”
            [step 1] but stops at “when,” cancels it, and continues on
            with a more accurate adverbial clause: “after all the
            figures sketched upon their limbs in youth have been
            blended” [2]. In a proofreading phase coordinated with the
            insertion of “&amp; tatooing” two lines up (see
            RN10ms68), HM revises “continual process of tatooing” to
            “continual opperation of this latter process” [3]. Probably
            at a later proofreading phase, he revised “these islanders”
            to “the warriors of the tribe” [4], to reflect the military
            subject of the armory insertion (RS10ms67). At the same time
            or later again he altered “tribe” to “island,” thus giving
            “the warriors of the island” [5]. Although tattooing is
            generally speaking a class and social marking (and therefore
            not exclusive to warriors), HM seems to want to associate
            the practice entirely with warriors, but he also broadens
            the focus beyond “tribe” to the entire “island.” In another
            proofreading phase, HM clarified the timing of the tattooing
            by inserting “in youth” [6] probably at the same time as the
            insertion of “longevity” in the following line (see
            RS10ms71-72). The idea that these are old warriors also
            connects with the description of the Ti (their residence) as
            an armory inserted as a paragraph preceding this one (see

            rhinoceros. Later, probably in conjunction with his
            tinkering in RN10ms73, he augmented the texture of the rhino
            imagery by adding the barnacle trope. But in the fair-copy
            stage, he dropped his barnacles for the more colorful image
            of “verde-antique.”</p>
          <p>HM first wrote “Their skin had a frightful scaly appearance
            &amp; the flsh lay upon them in huge folds like
            overlapping pleats of the rhinocerous” [step 1],
            inadvertently miswriting “flsh” for “flesh.” In a
            proofreading phase, he added the barnacle trope. Given the
            neatness and placement of this lengthy insertion, HM may
            have first composed the image on separate sheets of paper
            and then copied the insertion carefully between the MS
            lines. Even so, as he copied, he stumbled. After beginning
            with “which united with its singular color gave them the
            appearance of being covered with” [2], he stopped, realizing
            that in writing “covered with” he had skipped ahead of
            himself. He then canceled “covered with” and continued on
            with “completely covered with barnacles” [3], the text of
            which he had to inscribe up the right-hand margin.</p>
          <p>As soon as he added his barnacle image, HM also revised his
            sentence structure. Originally, he had presented his scaly
            skin and rhino image in two coordinate clauses. But with the
            barnacle insertion, he revised the second, rhino clause to a
            dependent clause, replacing “&amp;” with “while” [4].
            This sequence of revision is made virtually certain by the
            fact that HM was forced to insert the word “while” below
            rather than above the baseline because the “barnacle”
            insertion takes up the available space above the baseline;
            thus, the shift in sentence structure must have followed the
            barnacle insertion. At this same time, HM probably altered
            “this flsh” to “their flsh” by adding “eir” over the “is” in
            “this.” In the pencil substage, HM or Gansevoort underlined
            “overlapping” in pencil and put a dot near it in the right
            margin as a reminder for HM to revise the passage further
            [5].</p>

          <p>In the fair-copy stage, HM revised his description of the
            old warriors again. As it stood in MS, the execution of the
            barnacle image is doubly problematic, first because of the
            repetition of “scaly appearance” and “appearance of being
            covered,” and second because the barnacles do not quite
            square with the rhino pleats. Also, the doubling up of the
            texture images (barnacles and rhino pleats) seems to
            overbalance the color element, which is initially rendered
            as merely “dull green color.” HM eventually dropped the
            image of barnacled skin for a new color image: “made their
            limbs not a little resemble dusty specimens of
            verde-antique” [6]. This “verde-antique” image actually made
            its first appearance on MS page 6 (the verso of the present
            MS page; see RS10ms84) when, in the sleeping scene, HM
            substitutes in MS the words “animated specimens of
            verde-antique” for “old men.” In the print version, however,
            “old men” is restored at this point (line 93.23), and the
            image of “animated specimens of verde-antique” is altered to
            “dusty specimens of verde-antique” to replace the barnacles.
            HM also altered his <hi rend="italics">while-</hi> clause to
            a main clause. In response to the underlining of
            “overlapping,” the descriptive phrase concerning the rhino
            has also been altered a good deal. The flesh (now properly
            spelled) hangs on the warriors like a rhino only “in parts,”
            and the rhino itself is rendered more precisely, both
            anatomically and orthographically. That is, “pleats” becomes
            the rhino's “plaits” (either folds or plates)
            placed more specifically on the “flank” rather than
            indiscriminately on the “hide”; and, of course, the spelling
            of “rhinoceros” has been corrected.</p>

          <p>Continuing his description of the old warriors, HM first
            wrote another compound sentence: “The head was completely
            bald &amp; they presented no vestige of a beard” [step
            1]. Probably before adding his barnacle image in RS10ms74,
            he first augmented the image here of the wrinkled men
            established in the rhino image of the preceding sentence. He
            did this by inserting a simple participial phrase, “their
            faces puckered into a thousand wrinkels” [2]. Some time
            later, probably in stage III while he was adding new
            chapters to his work based on personal experience, HM added
            an extended description of the old warriors' toes.
            To do this, he composed his description on a separate,
            now-lost sheet (or sheets) and attached a final version of
            his text to MS leaf 5; he also placed an insertion device, a
            horizontal diamond with three dots, over the word “beard,”
            indicating the proper placement of his insertion [3].
            Because the inserted sheet(s), and any revisions on them,
            are lost, we can only infer the final text of that insertion
            from the version that appears in the English edition [4].
            The details of the insertion focus entirely on the
            warriors' toes and build to the comic observation
            that having gone barefoot for almost a century the
            warriors' splayed toes “bid one another keep open
            order.” The paragraph seems to be one of HM's
            rehearsed anecdotes, which he would have shared on board
            ship and in parlors repeatedly before sitting down to write.
            Perhaps he had simply forgotten to include it in his first
            draft and, reminded by a family member of its absence,
            inserted it in a logical place, thus creating a head to toe
            description of the old warriors.</p>

          <p>This sentence appears near the top of MS page 6. The first

            the reverse side of the same leaf, and an empty line space
            intervenes before the next sentence at this revision site
            begins. This indicates that HM may have paused in his
            composition of the MS once he had completed the preceding
            paragraph, and that he began the present sentence at a later
            time. The nature of the revision site also suggests that HM
            may have been composing fresh material because he interrupts
            himself in this new sentence to recast it entirely before
            going on. HM first composes the sentence focusing on the
            Chief and Kory-Kory falling asleep: “&amp; under its
            soporific influence the Cheif &amp; Kori Kori were in a
            short time slumbering beside us” [step 1]. In the midst of
            inscribing an undeciphered, single letter, he cancels the
            entire passage and the false start, and rethinks his
            sentence. In revision, HM adds more detail concerning the
            “short time” between eating and sleeping. He states now that
            he must “yield” to slumber, and emphasizes the quiet and
            darkness of the scene. However, he pauses after inscribing
            only the first two letters of “shadows” [2]. Canceling the
            false start, he continues on with “deepening shadows,”
            presumably to enhance the newly-conceived ominous quality of
            the scene. He concludes his sentence with Mehevi and
            Kory-Kory only appearing to be slumbering (see RS10e66).
            HM's impulse to dramatize by lending a potentially
            sinister air to the islanders' possibly feigned
            sleep seems to have occurred as he wrote the passage, rather
            than in a later proofreading phase.</p>

            proofreading phase, he revised “sort” to “kind” [2]. “Kind”

            postprandial “nap” among apparently sleeping, suspected
            cannibals. That this revision does not appear in the MS

            “While we continued gazing …” Apparently, HM is composing
            fresh material at this point. His initial idea was to have
            done with what he later calls the “new phenomenon” of the
            torchlights and to move directly into the dialogue between
            Tommo and Toby with an opener like “After regarding this new
            phenomenon, etc.” But he immediately decides to expand on
            the image of the lights: he first inscribes “After
            regarding” [step 1], but cancels it as soon as he writes it,
            and attempts a new sentence, this time with something like
            “In a few minutes dark figures appeared” [2]. But he quickly
            realizes that “In a few minutes” repeats “in a few moments”
            three lines above, and he cancels the phrase as soon as he
            inscribes it. Continuing to compose new material, HM finally
            lands upon a new opener with the idea of having the natives
            cavorting between the sailors and the fire. HM writes:
            “While we continued gazing on,” but stops at “on” [3],
            cancels it, and continues with “at this sight, dark figures
            appeared running to &amp; fro between us &amp; the
            fire, brought out” [4]. At this point, HM stopped to
            consider the course of his sentence. It is not clear whether
            HM intended that the “dark figures” of the sentence were
            bringing out some object for the sailors or that the image
            of the dark figures brings out some special (demonic) effect
            upon the scene. Either way, the grammatical structure of
            “brought out” is not promising, and as soon as HM came to
            this juncture, he cancels “between us &amp; the fire,
            brought out,” and continues on with “before the flames,
            while others dancing &amp; capering about looked like so
            many demons tending the tartarean furnaces” [5].</p>

            furnaces,” which may have occured later on. Presumably,
            HM's editors felt the mythical reference was not
            befitting a “common sailor” like Tommo and asked that it be

            the tense before completing the word “are.” Canceling the

            what do you suppose the devils have been feeding us up for

            were for something that you are afraid to talk about?” [2].
            In a proofreading phase, HM recognized that he has
            overloaded his sentence with “fors,” and begins to revise by
            changing the “what … for” construction to a “for what”
            construction. (HM is constrained to use the “for what”
            construction rather than a <hi rend="italics">why-</hi>
            clause because he has already begun the sentence with
            Toby's interjection “Why” and he wishes to avoid
            the oddity of “Why, why do you suppose.”) To do this, he
            first canceled the first “for,” and inserted “for what” [3]
            at the beginning of the sentence after the interjection
            “Why” and above “what,” perhaps forgetting to cancel the
            sentence opening “what.” Perhaps he also had the idea of
            writing something like “Why, for what reason,” etc. He
            interrupts that thought by canceling the “what” in his
            inserted “for what,” thereby leaving only the “for,” to give
            “Why for what do you suppose,” etc. [4]. This now places his

            the last three days”) to reduce the feel of redundancy, but
            that second “for” is too quickly repeated in the following
            line with “for something that you are afraid to talk about.”
            He therefore converts the second “for” to “during.” HM
            performed two other operations on the sentence, revising
            “without” to “unless” and “afraid” to “too frightened at”

            But the redundancy of “stuffing” and “stuff” inspired an
            immediate revision to “just the same way they treat swine
            before they kill them?” At the same time, he altered the

            question mark (converting it to a comma), and gives Toby an
            extra line: “why how can you tell what it is?” adding to

          <p>Most of the revisions at this site occurred in a late
            proofreading phase, after HM placed his paragraph marks.
            Initially, he completed three sentences concerning the
            natives who were busily “making arrangements that we did not
            at the time fully comprehend. But we were not left long at a
            loss to understand them. In a few minutes we were beckoned
            by the Cheif to approach” [step 1]. Probably in an early
            proofreading phase, HM revised the restrictive clause in
            “arrangements that we did not fully comprehend” to a more
            precise nonrestrictive clause: “arrangements the nature of
            which we did not fully comprehend” [2]. But later as he
            inserted his paragraph marks, he also restructured his
            sentences more fully. He first inserted a paragraph mark in
            front of the last sentence in this site, perhaps also adding
            “but” to the opening phrase to give “In but a few minutes”
            [3]. HM then reconceived his paragraph by canceling his mark
            and repositioning it in front of the preceding sentence. At
            the same time, perhaps hearing the infelicity of “left long
            at a loss to understand them,” he canceled “at a loss to
            understand them,” and inserted the words “in our ignorance:”
            above the deletion [4]. The colon, in HM's hand, is
            a unique occurrence in this MS, and its effect is to restore
            a crisp separation of the two clauses while maintaining a
            compound sentence structure. Even so, HM next rejected that
            structure for a more conventional compound sentence.
            Canceling “In,” he squeezed the conjunction “for” in front
            of the canceled paragraph mark and inserted “had elapsed
            when” to give “for but a few minutes had elapsed when we
            were beckoned by the Cheif to approach” [5]. Probably at
            this time he repositioned his paragraph mark again, by
            canceling the mark placed in front of “But” and putting it
            further down in front of the following sentence so as to
            include all sentences at this site in one paragraph.</p>

            fully comprehend” to “we could not comprehend,” which
            removes the self-conscious time frame and enhances the
            immediacy of the dramatic moment. Secondly, to remove the
            redundancy of “but” in his compound sentence, he revised
            “but a few moments” to “a few moments only.” Finally, he

          <p>The irregular spacing between sentences in line 2 and the

            of composing and stopped after the sentence ending with
            “desire” or even mid-sentence at the end of line 2 with
            “descended.” Whatever the circumstances, he initially writes
            “As soon as I descended from the ‘pipi’ the procession
            formed around me enclosing us in it's centre, where
            part of the time carried by ‘KoKori,’ &amp; occasionaly
            relieving him by walking along with a staff” [step 1].
            Reaching “staff,” he immediately cancels that word and
            continues on with “spear I.” Realizing perhaps that his
            sentence structure is leading up to an anticlimactic clause
            “I remained,” he cancels the “I” in “spear I” and inserts “I
            remained” earlier in the sentence after “where.” In a series
            of proofreading phases, he inserted “from his burden” to
            give “&amp; occasionaly relieving him from his burden”
            [4] and revised “walking” to “limping” [5] since “walking
            along with a spear” does not necessarily depict the use of
            the spear as a cane. In a later proofreading phase, HM may
            have realized that he has removed Toby from the narrative
            point of view. He therefore revised the “I” in “As soon as I
            descended” to “we” and “around me” to “anew” [6].</p>
          <p>The revision of “walking” to “limping” [5] raises serious
            questions about the severity and / or reality of
            Tommo's (i.e. HM's) leg wound. In his
            narrative, HM has Tommo report that he sustains a crippling
            leg ailment in his five-day trek through the mountains
            before arriving in the Typee Valley. The pain is severe but
            not enough to prevent his climbing the steep cliffs;
            however, in the valley he must be carried about by
            Kory-Kory, and his pain comes and goes depending upon his
            psychological state. Did HM himself suffer such a wound? One
            implication of the revision of “walking” to “limping” is
            that he did not. In writing, HM is transcribing basic
            experiential detail from memory at the same time as he is
            transforming those remembered details into narrative
            “facts.” That is, the author must alter his factual past (I
            had no limp) to create a narrative past (Tommo has a limp).
            Even though he has already established Tommo's leg
            wound in his narrative, fragments of HM's actual
            healthy condition bleed into his storytelling. Thus, he
            first writes that Tommo is “walking” with a staff or spear
            when in fact he must be “limping.”</p>

            removing Toby from the final scene, with subsequent uses of

            for all I knew might” [step 1], with the idea that the
            native music “might be sung by the devotees of Ceres,” an
            image that eventually emerges in the following sentence (see
            RS10ms146-48). But he interrupts the idea in mid-sentence,
            cancels “for all I knew might,” and inscribes only “they s”
            [2]. At this point he may have retained his image of Ceres
            and is attempting to say something like “which they sang
            like the devotees of Ceres.” Or, having postponed the image
            for the next sentence, he may have something like “which
            they sang with various alternations” in mind. In any case,
            he cancels the false start “they s” and finishes his
            sentence “which with various alternations they continued,”
            etc. [3]. In a later proofreading phase, HM revised “wild
            recitative” to “musical recitative” [4], a change that adds
            more civility, solemnity, and westernized culture to the
            procession. However, HM holds on to the word “wild,”

          <p>The false start on “procession” [step 1] indicates that
            HM's idea to insert the notion of “the picturesque”
            may have come as he was composing. But like the shift from
            “wild” to “musical” in RN10ms144-45, the immediate expansion
            to “picturesque procession” helps familiarize and genialize
            the scene. By invoking the picturesque (a loaded term in
            eighteenth- and nineteenth-century aesthetics), HM sets up a
            westernizing frame of reference for readers that extends
            throughout this passage to the end of the chapter.
            Continuing to compose, HM writes that the picturesque
            procession “might have been taken for a throng of the
            ancient devotees of Ceres about” [2], stopping at “about”
            with the idea of saying something like “the devotees of
            Ceres about to wend” or “wending about.” He may even have
            considered something more erudite such as “about which one
            reads in classical mythology.” Whatever the options, he
            immediately cancels “about” and continues on, inscribing
            only “wending its” [3], and again interrupting himself, this
            time at the word “its.” Considering the option of a plural
            pronoun, he cancels “its” and continues on with “their” to
            give “wending their way with votive offerings towards the
            alters of the goddess” [4]. In a proofreading phase, perhaps
            triggered by the revision of “wild” to “musical” in
            RN10ms144-45, HM first expanded his sentence by inserting
            “whose recesses echoed with their wild chants” after
            “valley” [5]. But probably at this same time he canceled
            that relative clause as well as his insertion caret, and
            inserted the more economical and rhythmic prepositional
            phrase, “with wild chants,” after “moving” [6].</p>

          <p>In the first English edition the entire paragraph
            describing the picturesque procession, including its
            allusion to Ceres, was removed [7], either by HM or an
            editor, probably to reduce Tommo's too-erudite
            tone.</p>

          <p>The conversion of “proceeded along” [step 1] to “proceeded
            on our way” [2] made in a proofreading phase removes the
            amusing confusion of the predicate particle “along” in
            “proceeded along” as a preposition yielding “along bands of
            nymphs.” “On our way” makes it clear that Tommo and Toby are
            not proceeding on top of the bands of nymphs. The revision
            also underscores the “we” of the clause and hence the
            presence of Toby. But “on our way” adds a redundancy with
            the repetition of “way” in “wending their way” in the
            previous line. Since HM sedulously removes such repetitions,
            the adding of “on our way” is puzzling. One remote
            explanation may be that HM had decided at this point to
            remove the preceding paragraph description of the
            picturesque procession (RS10ms146-48)—and with it “wending
            their way”—but had not yet made that cancellation; thus,
            with the anticipated cancellation in mind, he might have
            felt free to add “on our way” without its causing a
            repetition.</p>

            However, the removal of the “picturesque procession”
            paragraph eliminated the base for the reference; hence, the
            revision of “nymphs” to “young girls” [3]. But HM did not
            need such tight referencing to justify the use of the word
            “nymphs,” which he uses repeatedly throughout <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>. Chances are that the word was
            booted during the preparation of the English edition for its

            the letter <hi rend="italics">m</hi> the word “our” [2].

            currency among American readers. HM may have thought better
            of the image and removed it in the fair-copy stage, or it
            may have been deleted by a fastidious editor preparing the
            English edition. In either event, the image reemerged in the

            [step 1]. He probably canceled “the” in a proofreading phase
            to render the less specific and pluralized “scenes &amp;

            “day day” leaving out the “after.” Continuing on with
            “redoubling the assiduity of their attentions” [2], he
            commits himself to an expanded sentence structure that will
            delay the main predicate of his subject (“The natives”) and
            tax reader attention. Probably at this point he decides to
            convert “redoubling” into his main predicate “redoubled” by
            writing “ed” over the “ing” in “redoubling” [3]. He then
            goes on with a new clause. At this time, or perhaps later,
            in a proofreading phase, he returned to the “day day”

          <p>Since no version of this undeciphered word survives in any
            printed edition, we have little to go on but context in
            decoding it. The context suggests that the word should have
            the meaning of something like “lessen” or “hide”: why, Tommo
            is asking, would the islanders lessen or hide their perfidy
            if they were going to kill them eventually? The word seems
            to begin with a “ch” which would support “chasten.” However,
            the initial letters could also be “el,” suggesting the word
            might possibly be read as “elaborate,” i.e., the natives are
            taking elaborate measures to conceal their perfidy. But this
            seems a stretch. The opening letters might, however, be an
            uncanceled false start; this would suggest that the word is
            shorter than it appears and begins with “at” or “ab”
            (perhaps “abate”). In his pencil substage, HM or Gansevoort
            underlined this word in pencil, placing a dot in the margin
            next to it. Apparently that reader could not decipher it
            either. The insertion of “thus” [2] to refer back to the
            natives' assiduous attentions was done in a
            proofreading phase, and may have been suggested in the
            pencil substage, in which case the underlining of the

            [2] in the compound adverb “somewhere beyond” as soon as he
            wrote it, but chances are he made all the revisions in this
            site during the same proofreading phase. At this later
            point, he revised “place” to “put” and then “that” to
            “which” [3]. After this, he inserted “the power of that”

            close to his already inserted “which,” he drew a thin
            vertical line between “that” and “which.” However, he does

            “which,” he immediately changes that word to “until” and
            continues to the end of his sentence: “until I should have
            recovered from the severe lameness that now affected me”
            [2]. In reflecting on this sentence, either upon the
            immediate completion of it or some time later in
            proofreading, HM made two minor changes, canceling “now” and
            revising “affected” by writing “licted” over “ected” to give
            “afflicted” [3]. He then began tinkering with the entire
            sentence, keeping the focus at first on the impossibility of
            travel for Tommo by revising “endure the fatigue of” to
            “undertake” to give “undertake a journey” [4]. Next, he
            revised with a new focus entirely, shifting from the
            impossibility of travel to the idleness of thinking about
            travel. In all likelihood, he first canceled “undertake” and
            inserted “think of.” He then altered “a journey” to
            “journeying” to give “it was impossible for me to think of
            journeying.” This required the further change of “like this”
            to “from the place” [5]. HM also altered “impossible” to
            “idle” [6], either at this time or at an earlier step.</p>

            middle of the second word “soothing,” writing “Mild

            soothing though they were, their remedies….” Rethinking this

            of the simple past “did not alleviate,” which he had
            established in previous sentences. However, he immediately
            decides to stick with his original intention, cancels “had
            not,” and inscribes the rest of his clause: “alleviate the
            violence of the disorder” [3]. In a proofreading phase (or

          <p>In the fair-copy stage, HM tinkered in this passage with
            the words “remedies” and “applications.” He essentially
            reverses their placement by revising “the herbal
            applications” to “the herbal remedies” and “These mild
            remedies” to “These mild applications” [5]. This effectively
            places the general term “remedy” before the more specific
            “application”; however, the reason for the switch may have
            less to do with such subtle hierarchies and more to do with
            the fact that HM had, in MS, expanded “powerful agent” to
            “powerful remedial agent” in the next clause, thus creating
            an undesired redundancy with “These mild remedies” (see
            RS11ms15). The revision of “alleviate the violence of the
            disorder” to “remove the disorder” resolves another problem
            lurking in the original text. Here, HM failed to note the
            contradiction in Tommo's remark that although the
            native remedies soothe his pain, they do not “alleviate the
            violence of the disorder.” In fact, he means to complain

            “remedies” and “applications” made at a later stage in
            RS11e22-23.) During the same proofreading phase, HM might
            also have revised “prolonged &amp; indefinite suffering”
            to “acute &amp; prolonged suffering” [3]. The revision

          <p>The initial wording of this paragraph appears without
            revision in MS [step 1]. However, in his fair-copy stage, HM
            made five major grammatical changes, which could have
            occurred in any sequence. Initially, HM's passage
            consisted of a compound-complex sentence and a second
            compound sentence. 1) HM altered the first clause of the
            compound clauses of his first sentence by recombining
            “surgeons of the fleet” and “French man of war” and placing
            them together in an opening prepositional phrase. 2) In this
            first sentence, he created a new <hi rend="italics">which</hi>- clause concerning the fleet's position
            in the bay. 3) He changed the tense of the second clause of
            his compound sentence from the present “it might easily be
            obtained” to the present perfect “it might easily have been
            obtained.” 4) He modified his already existing conditional
            dependent clause “were the circumstances of the case made
            known” to “could I have made my case known to them.” These
            revisions created a complex sentence with one main clause
            and two dependent clauses. 5) His second sentence was
            originally a compound interrogative concerning how and whom.
            HM reduced this to a simple interrogative sentence: “But how
            could that be effected?”</p>

        <div id="RN11ms18e29-30" synch="RS11ms18e29-30" type="narr">
          <p>At this point, HM seems to be composing new material. His
            goal is to have Tommo express certain options in his attempt
            to convince Toby to go to Nuku Hiva Bay (Taiohae) and return
            either by sea with a rescue ship or by land with medicine.
            But the goal is daunting, for he fails, in both the initial
            composition and revision, to achieve a solid grammatical
            sentence in manuscript. Even so, the first English edition
            shows that further revisions got the sentence-long paragraph
            into shape. Initially HM's plan is to set up a
            series of “-ing” phrases concerning Toby —“his going round
            to Nuuheva…, getting possession of the desired supplies…,
            and [returning by boat or land]”—but he abandons that
            parallelism by canceling his “getting” phrase (presumably to
            put this off until later), gets lost in a series of nested
            dependent clauses, and inscribes “to procure” instead of
            “procuring” as a substitute for his canceled
            "getting" phrase, thus creating an
            incomplete sentence.</p>
          <p>A probable sequence of revisions is as follows. HM first
            inscribed “I proposed to Toby the practicability of his
            going round to ‘Nuuheva,’ getting possession of the desired
            supplies” [step 1]. He immediately cancels “getting the
            possession of the desired supplies” and plunges into a
            somewhat overloaded <hi rend="italics">if</hi>- clause
            strategy: “&amp; if he could not succeed in having one
            of the boats of the squadron accompany him in which case I
            might be remanded to the shipping, to” [2]. He stops at “to”
            with the idea of going on with the split infinitive “to at
            least procure,” etc. but catches himself in mid-thought,
            cancels “to,” and continues on with “at least to procure the
            supplies of which I stood in need &amp; effect his
            return overland” [3]. In a proofreading phase most likely
            after initial composition, he canceled “having” and
            “accompany him” and inserted “in returning to the valley by
            water in” to give “if he could not succeed in in [sic]
            returning to the valley by water in one of the boats of the
            squadron,” etc. (Here, HM misses the inadvertent repetition
            of “in” in “in in returning.”) This new wording emphasizes
            Toby's “return” to the Typee valley and clarifies
            Toby's subsequent resistance to a plan requiring
            him to return. Since the embedded <hi rend="italics">in
              which case</hi>- clause creates a sentence overload, HM
            inserted dashes around it for grammatical clarity [5]. HM
            also tinkered with single words, altering “supplies” to
            “succor” and inserting a redundant “perhaps” [6], but then
            removing it [7].</p>

        <div id="RN11e29-30" synch="RS11ms18e29-30" type="narr">
          <p>HM's incomplete sentence was not corrected until
            his fair-copy stage. The solution to the problem was to
            abandon the “ing” parallelism altogether for a series of
            clauses. In one revision, then, “the practicability of his
            going round to ‘Nuuheva’ is changed to “that he should
            endeavour to go round to Nukuheva” [8]. And in a second more
            involved set of revisions, the nested dependent clauses and
            the “to procure” problems are resolved. Here, “in which case
            I might be remanded to the shipping—at least to procure the
            succor of which I stood in need” is revised to “and taking
            me off, he might at least procure me some proper
          medicines.”</p>

          <p>Revising as he writes, HM inscribes but expands and then
            contracts a simple sentence. Initially he writes “My
            companion listened to the proposition in silence &amp;
            at first did not appear any” [step 1]. Anticipating the
            phrase “by any means” with the false start “any,” he stops
            himself, cancels “any” by writing the word “by” over it, and
            continues on with “by any means to relish it” [2]. In a
            proofreading phase, HM canceled “it” and inserted above it
            “this expression of my wishes,” to give “&amp; at first
            did not appear by any means to relish this expression of my
            wishes” [3]. At a later moment, probably in coordination
            with the insertion of the word “proposition” a few lines
            down in RS11ms25, he canceled “the proposition in” to “me
            in,” thus providing an antecedent personal pronoun for “my
            wishes” [4]. Then later on, in the pencil substage, he or
            his brother Gansevoort used pencil to scribble over “by any
            means to relish” and the inserted phrase “this expression of
            my wishes,” and inscribed also in pencil the words “the
            idea” beneath the canceled word “it” to suggest the revised
            line “My companion listened to me in silence &amp; at
            first did not appear to relish the idea” [5]. Still later HM
            returned to the MS and confirmed the pencil cancellations by
            canceling the two phrases in ink and inserting at the end of
            the preceding line the incomplete phrase “to relish
          idea.”</p>

            favor with the natives to make good a retreat before we
            might be subjected to” [step 1], with the idea of finishing
            his thought with something like “we might be subjected to a
            sudden revolution,” etc.; but he stops at “to” in order to
            rethink and immediately revises to “we might experience some
            sudden revolution in this smiling (?) aspect of affairs”
            [2]. In a proofreading phase, he changed “might” to “should”
            and revised “revolution in this smiling aspect of affairs”
            to “alteration in their behavior” [3]. Given the squeezed-in
            position of the caret at this site, this last revision must

            likely is that HM deleted the reference here to the
            Typees' “smiling aspect of affairs” because his use
            of Tommo's “good cheer” in the insertion of
            RS11ms21-24 (which triggered RS11ms20) created an

            RS11ms21-29e37-48:</hi> These nine MS sites and twelve
            English edition sites involve one of the largest insertions
            in the extant <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> MS. Generally HM
            inscribed insertions this size on separate insertion slips.
            An insertion this size on a MS leaf itself is unique in this
            document but typical of HM's large revisions found
            in the MSS of later works (such as <hi rend="italics">The
              Confidence-Man</hi>), and probably typical of the revision
            process HM was already beginning to adopt with <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>. That is, HM would compose for a
            stretch on a leaf, pause to revise, and then take space on
            that leaf to write out a revision to be inserted elsewhere
            on the leaf. Chances are this resulted in leaves so heavily
            revised that they had to be copied onto a clean leaf.
            Because HM was writing on stitched booklets of blank paper,
            he might have restrained himself from composing too much in
            such a fashion. Even so, the fact that one-third of the MS
            consists of loose leaves torn from a booklet suggests that
            he often enough found himself having to tear away heavily
            revised leaves from his bound booklets. In the present
            series of revision sites, HM proceeded three-fourths of the
            way down MS page 12, paused to reread, revised what he had
            written a bit, and then composed five additional lines
            (29-33) to be inserted some eighteen lines up the page. In
            this case the actual revisions in the insertion text are
            few, so the entire leaf is clean enough to keep, rather than
            copy, onto a fresh leaf and discard. HM then drew lines
            above, below, and to the left of the insertion, created
            matching insertion devices for the accurate placement of the
            five new lines, and inscribed in the left margin the words
            “inserted above.” Once done with this, he filled out the
            remainder of the leaf with five more lines of text, picking
            up his narrative where he had previously left off before
            making his insertion. Later fair-copy revisions appearing in
            the English edition were subsequently made in additional
            stages. The following revision narrative (in two MS sections
            and one English edition section) picks up the story well
            before HM comes to his insertion. (Because most of
            RS11ms25-29 was composed before RS11ms21-24, sites
            RS11ms25-29 are treated first.)</p>

          <p>HM composes these eighteen lines in essentially one burst
            of writing. He pauses only once at the word “might” [step
            1], which he revises immediately to the more definitive
            “would,” and continues on to the completion of his final
            sentence, “This was unanswerable reasoning…,” with its
            misinscribed word “clug” (for “clung”) [2]. The sequence of

            “yield” (variously spelled) in two successive sentences and
            seen the misspelled “clug.” Chances are he corrected these
            infelicities in an early proofreading phase by revising “I
            could not but yield to” to “could not but convince me” [3],
            and by inserting an “n” into “clug” for “clung” [4]. Also in
            a proofreading phase, HM revised “natives” to “islanders”
            [5] to eliminate the repetition of “natives” farther down
            the page. HM then set about drafting the insertion to
            precede this paragraph (see RS11ms21-24) by returning to the
            end of the paragraph and inscribing five additional lines
            [6]. Once he completed and revised the new insertion text,
            he moved up to the head of his paragraph and revised its
            opening line to accommodate the new insertion to precede it.
            To do this he canceled “There” and began writing above the
            baseline with the idea of saying something like “When he
            thus considered my proposition.” But he stopped himself in
            mid-word, inscribing only “When he th” [7]. Immediately
            canceling the false start “th” [8], he finished the
            insertion as “When he considered my proposition, there” [9]
            and drew matching insertion devices (a spoked circle in a
            square) for the five-line insertion: one at the place of
            insertion, the other before the actual insertion situated at
            the bottom of the page. HM also drew a third device (a
            framed <hi rend="italics">X</hi>) at the end of his
            insertion, as well as lines on three sides of the five
            lines, including one down the left margin with the words
            “inserted above” inscribed vertically along the line.
            Satisfied with his various insertions, HM returned to his
            narrative, and continued to inscribe two more sentences to
            fill the rest of his leaf, beginning with “To this end I
            continued to importune him,” etc. [10], making direct
            reference to “the other part of my plan” five lines up and
            just before his five insertion lines. Much later in his
            paragraph substage, he inserted a paragraph mark before “To
            this end” [11], but soon enough realized that this sentence
            is his conclusion to the preceding heavily revised
            paragraph, so he canceled the mark and repositioned it in
            front of the following sentence [12].</p>

        <div id="RN11ms21-24" synch="RS11ms21-24" type="narr">
          <p>Soon after composing lines 11-29, HM composed his five-line
            insertion [step 1]. (Although these flow directly out of the
            lines preceding them, their content does not follow
            logically from what precedes them, and they are clearly
            intended for placement elsewhere.) Once HM completed the
            five lines, he then tinkered with the insertion in three
            places. Although the exact sequencing of these proofreading
            changes is not certain, at least one and perhaps all three
            were made soon after the initial composition of the five
            lines and before HM positioned the inserted passage. This is
            certain because one of the lines HM drew around the passage
            to indicate its separation from the main body of the text
            crosses over the inserted word “deserting.” HM's
            three revisions are as follows: he revised “he could not
            think of leaving me” to “he could not think of deserting me”
            [2], “my leg would soon be better” to “I would soon be
            better” [3], and “the bay” to “Nuuheva” [4]. The first
            intensifies Tommo's sense of growing resentment
            toward Toby's eventual departure. The second is one
            of several revisions converting Tommo's specific
            leg wound into a more general sense of personal ailment. And
            the third ensures that readers would not confuse Nuku Hiva
            bay (the village of Taiohae) with the Typees' bay
            (Comptroller Bay). Once he was satisfied with the passage,
            he placed it eighteen lines up the page by drawing lines on
            three sides of the passage and positioning his insertion
            devices at the beginning and end of the passage (a spoked
            circle in a square and an <hi rend="italics">X</hi> in a
            picture frame, respectively) to match another insertion
            symbol (another spoked circle in square) at the intended
            point of insertion. He then inscribed “inserted above”
            sideways up the left margin [5].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM continued to revise his
            insertion [step 1] in three places. He returned “deserting
            me” back to its original “leaving me” and reduced the
            cumbersome “in this helpless situation to which I was
            reduced” to simply “my helpless condition” [2]. He also
            modified “would” to “should.” And he tightened “in the
            course of a few days we would be enabled to return together
            to Nuuheva” by reducing its compound dependent clause to a
            dependent clause with a compound verbal to give “enable in a
            few days to return with him to Nukuheva.”</p>

        <div id="RN11e37-50" synch="RS11e37-50" type="narr">
          <p>HM tinkered with this passage after completing his MS, and
            editors may have revised it during the preparation of the
            English edition. It is impossible to determine the precise
            sequence of the fourteen changes to these five sentences;
            therefore, the five "steps" at this revision site refer only
            to the sentences in which changes are found. During the
            pencil substage, HM or Gansevoort sensed the need for
            further revisions and placed a dot in the margin to the left
            of the passage. The biggest change is with HM's
            rather clumsy transitional <hi rend="italics">when</hi>-
            clause inserted at RS11ms25, which does not quite work
            coming as it does now after the five-line insertion of
            RS11ms26-29. To remedy the problem, the <hi rend="italics">when</hi>- clause was dropped for “Added to this” [step
            1]. In addition the following “there was” clause has been
            tightened considerably to “he could not bear the idea of
            again returning to this dangerous place.” This passage has
            also been toned down with two other changes: “something
            inconceivably repulsive to him” has been changed to the more
            direct “he could not bear,” and “dangerous vicinity” has
            become simply “dangerous place” [1], no doubt to lower
            Tommo's diction. Several other tinkerings occur in
            this sentence: HM's first two original sentences
            have been combined into a compound sentence by the
            conjunction “and”; “a number of their men” has been
            simplified to “a boat's crew”; and the bland
            “dangers to which I was exposed” has been revised to the
            more dramatic “Typees” [1]. A second set of revisions is a
            bit problematic. The change from “arguments that could not
            but convince me” to “arguments that I could not answer”
            seems advisable, but the use here of “answer” is repeated
            later with “This was unanswerable.” Since the repetition is
            not rhetorically useful, and since HM is meticulous
            elsewhere in reducing such redundancies, someone other than
            HM may have made the revision. On the heels of this is the
            change from “set forth the improbability” to “urge the
            improbability,” which seems likely to be HM's. On
            the other hand, the revision of “tribe” to “clan” seems
            unusual [2]. “Clan” occurs only nine other times throughout
            the book as opposed to forty-four occurrences of the word
            “tribe.” “Clan” does not appear in HM's three
            manuscript chapters; “tribe” appears five times. A remote
            but not unlikely possibility is that “clan” is not
            HM's usage, and that an editor (like John
            Murray's Henry Milton) used the word as an
            alternative for “tribe” in copyediting the book. More
            familiar kinds of revisions are found in a third set. Here
            Toby's pretentious “even should they yeild to my
            representations in this respect” has been shortened to the
            more direct “even should they consent” [3]. Similarly “they
            would only be the means of producing” has become “they would
            only produce” [3]. More interesting is the shift in
            preposition from “sacrificed to the fierce passions of the
            islanders” to “sacrificed by these ferocious islanders” [3],
            which seems less romantic although a bit more dramatic. A
            fourth set of revisions involves two small snips:
            “unanswerable reasoning” has been reduced to “unanswerable”
            and “yet succeed” to “succeed” [4], both of which might have
            been performed by an editor. Finally, the fifth set of
            revisions eliminates the pretentious “I continued to
            importune him” [5] and converts a reasonably well-balanced
            simple sentence with an introductory prepositional phrase to
            a repetitive compound clause “and at last I overcame his
            scruples, and he agreed to make the attempt” [5].</p>

          <p>Returning perhaps to a copying phase, HM continues with the
            narrative in a new paragraph beginning with “As soon as we
            succeeded in making the natives understand my intentions
            they broke out into the most vehement opposition of the
            measure” [step 1]. (The word “natives” repeats the same
            usage a few lines up, and HM's awareness of this
            later on probably triggered his revision of “natives” to
            “islanders” in RS11ms28.) In a proofreading phase, HM
            revised “opposition of” to “opposition to” [2].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM altered “my intentions” to “our
            intention” [3], thus stressing Tommo's communion
            with Toby; and an editor preparing the English edition may
            have corrected the pronoun agreement. HM may have also
            revised “their approbation of it” to “obtaining their
            consent” to lower Tommo's diction and rid the text
            of a mess of pronouns. But the revision creates a repetition
            of “consent” at RS11ms43 (where HM had previously revised
            “yeild” to “consent”). Given HM's tendency to ward
            off redundancy, the later shift here to “consent” (creating
            an unnecessary echo) was likely performed by an editor.</p>

          <p>Revising as he writes, HM entertains two alternating
            thoughts about what sentence to go with. He originally
            begins with something like “At the bare thought of leaving,”
            but stops himself mid-thought, canceling the only word
            registered, “At” [step 1]. He then writes “Kori Kori in
            particular” [2] as if planning to give some version of the
            two clauses that he eventually inscribes, possibly “Kori
            Kori in particular threw himself into a perfect paroxysm of
            gestures.” However, he stops himself again in mid-thought,
            cancels the phrase, and quickly returns to his original
            idea: “At the bare thought of one of us leaving.” And he
            continues on to Kory-Kory's “grief &amp;
            consternation” and “paroxyism of gestures” in the next
            lines.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="RN11ms32e53-54" synch="RS11ms32e53-54" type="narr">
          <p>Continuing to revise as he writes, HM stops himself in
            mid-thought inscribing the false start “the detest” [step
            1], intending something like “the detestable inhabitants of
            that bay.” The ensuing comic scene portrays Kory-Kory
            ironically as a kind of civilized savage who impugns the
            incivility of his savage neighbors. The immediate revision
            of “detestable” to “uncivilized inhabitants” announces this
            idea by attributing to Kory-Kory a certain degree of
            superiority and exclusive civility. In a proofreading phase,
            HM altered “intending” to “intended” [2] by meticulously
            deleting the “ing” in “intending” with several minute pen
            strokes and writing “ed” over the cancellation. This shifts
            the object of the participial phrase from “he” (Kory-Kory)
            to “gestures” (his language), which has the subtle effect of
            locating intended meaning in interpretable gesture not
            person. Elsewhere, Tommo assures us that he learns to
            understand the natives through their gesturing.</p>

          <p>In the fair-copy stage, HM may have accentuated the focus
            on gesture by converting the participial phrase to a fuller
            unrestricted clause “which were intended” [3]. Similarly, he
            inserted the <hi rend="italics">not only</hi>–<hi rend="italics">but also</hi> construction in the <hi rend="italics">which</hi>- clause to eliminate the
            repetition of “and.”</p>

            time” in mind, the way speakers frequently conceptualize
            time in spatial units, as with the phrase “point in time.”
            The correction to “even for a time” [2] may have been made
            by HM or an editor as late as the preparation of the English
            edition.</p>

          <p>Initially HM seems to be writing at a fairly efficient
            rate. He inscribes his sentence—“Ultimaly however I
            vanquished these objections by appealing to my limb which I
            assured the natives would speedily recover if Toby were now
            permitted to obtain the supplies I needed” [step 1]—without
            hesitation, but returned to it in one or two proofreading
            phases. The shift from “vanquished” to “over bore” [2] not
            only eliminates an unrealistic and unnecessarily
            militaristic term but also emphasizes that Tommo gets his
            way through persistence of argumentation. Perhaps at the
            same time or during a different proofreading phase, HM
            revised “limb” to “illness” [3], a pattern of revision
            (repeated elsewhere) that stresses Tommo's general
            ailment rather than just his ailing leg. This revision
            obliged him to restructure the subsequent relative clause
            from “which I assured the natives would speedily recover” to
            “from which I assured the natives I would speedily
          recover.”</p>

            the five revisions are routine and might have been performed
            in copyediting. The misinscribed “Ultimaly” was cut
            altogether (RS11e56); “these objections” became “his
            objections” (RS11e57); and “would” is altered to “should”
            (RS11e59). The shift from “illness” to “lameness” (RS11e58)
            specifies the ailment and adds to the pathos; it may have
            been HM's change, although an editor might have
            suggested it. Similarly, the dropping of “now” from “were
            now permitted” eliminates a confusion of time frames; it may
            have derived from HM's growing sensitivity to
            narrative unity, or it may have been a routine editorial
            correction.</p>

            expanding at this point, and simply thought better of it. In
            either case, he cancels his ampersand as soon as he writes
            it [2]. In a proofreading phase (perhaps as soon as he
            finished his sentence), HM clarified the number of guides
            Toby will have by inserting “one or two” [3]. Similar
            alterations of numbers and amounts occur throughout the

            the end of this sentence, he found himself revising as he

            participial phrases and a compound predicate. He first
            writes “who promising to return … &amp; bidding me keep
            up my spirits … turned round the corner … and attended by
            the venerable Maheyo plunged with him into the depth” [step

            But he stops at “depth” and, perhaps thinking the phrasing
            has become too melodramatic, cancels “plunged with him into
            the depth,” and continues on with the more clinical “was
            soon lost to my view” [2]. The canceled “plunged” and
            “depth,” with their psychological connotation of soul
            diving, and the alternative shift to Tommo's point

          <p>HM performed two additional revisions in the fair-copy

            sentence with a compound predicate “He promised … and …
            turned” [4]. He also revised “lost to my view” to “out of

          <p>HM performed only minor revisions to this sentence in MS;
            however, he tinkered with it considerably in his fair-copy
            stage. With the shift from “house” [step 1] to “dwelling”
            [2], HM selects a broader and more culturally neutral
            designation. The insertion itself, occurring in a
            proofreading phase, is placed almost two words to the left
            of the word it replaces, which suggests that HM may have

            proper spelling was provided by someone other than HM. With
            regard to the second half of his original compound sentence,
            HM himself probably performed the four kinds of alterations
            evident in RS11e66 [4]. 1) He converted the second half of
            this compound from a main clause with a compound predicate
            to a main clause with a single predicate. 2) And he changed
            the coordinating conjunction from “but” to “and.” 3) He
            dropped the idea of Tommo's “struggling against
            [his melancholly reflections]” but added in compensation his
            being “almost in despair.” Finally, it seems “flung” was too
            colloquial even for the sailor Tommo, so it was revised to
            “threw.”</p>

            “two,” opts for “an hour's time,” and continues

            he immediately cancels it, continues on with “little,” and

            have noticed the repetition of “way” and revised the first
            iteration in “showing him the way” to “showing him the
            route” [4]. Probably during a subsequent proofreading phase,

            “It.” Either immediately or in a proofreading phase, he

            period” cancellation and following “noon of this same day”

          <p>Two scenarios are possible at this revision site. Most
            likely HM inscribes “surrounded by the slumbering persons”
            [step A1], but immediately or just as he begins to inscribe
            “of,” he cancels “persons” and opts for “forms of
            its' inmates” by inserting “forms” above “persons”
            [A2] and completing his sentence. However, an insertion
            above a canceled word typically signifies a revision
            performed in a proofreading phase. In this second scenario
            HM would have inscribed his entire sentence [step B1], but
            not changed “persons” to “forms” until much later in a
            proofreading phase, probably to eliminate the redundancy of
            “some persons” three lines down (see RS11ms50). But several
            factors argue against this standard analysis. First, the
            phrase “persons of its' inmates” is an odd
            formulation. Granted, in other contexts (such as “drugs were
            found on their persons”), it is not unheard of, and granted,
            HM let a similarly odd, implied formulation, “season of the
            day,” stand a few lines up. Even so, to imagine the
            inmate's “slumbering persons” is a linguistic
            stretch. Second, a small mark beneath the regularly
            inscribed “of” following “persons” indicates that HM
            interrupted himself in writing “of.” The suggestion here is
            that HM initially had “slumbering persons” in mind, then
            reconceived this as “forms of its' inmates,” began
            writing the “of” in this expression, but stopped himself to
            cancel “persons” and insert “forms,” at which point he
            returned to his partially inscribed “of” to complete that
            word and continue on.</p>

          <p>In either case, the passage remained unaltered until the
            fair-copy stage in which HM revised “forms of its'
            inmates” to “slumbering inmates” [3], something of a version
            of the first scenario. No doubt, an editor altered
            “its'” to “its.” An editor, in preparing the
            English edition, might also be responsible for revising
            “that pervaded everything” to the more standard restrictive
            clause format of “which prevailed.”</p>

          <p>HM revises while perhaps copying from earlier drafts or
            notes. Initially he writes “I thought I heard faint shouting
            as tho’ proceeding from the” [step 1] with the idea of
            continuing on with something like “proceeding from the depth
            of the grove.” But he immediately shifts to “proceeding from
            some persons” and continues on to the end of the sentence
            [2]. (His use of “persons” here may have triggered, in a
            later proofreading phase, his revision of “slumbering
            persons” to “slumbering forms” in RS11ms46, step B2.) In a
            proofreading phase, HM altered “faint shouting” to “faint
            shouts” [2]. In another proofreading revision, HM backed
            away from his earlier depiction of Marheyo's house
            as a “mansion” found at the end of MS chapter 10. HM first
            canceled “mansion,” squeezing in “house” [4] above and to
            the right; he also drew a short line indicating the
            word's placement after “the.” However, “house”
            appears three times in the first eleven lines of this
            MS page, and HM may have canceled “the house” to reduce the
            repetitions (see also RS11ms53). In doing so, he inserted
            “our habitation” [5]. “Our” may refer to Tommo and Toby, but
            since Toby is absent, the pronoun now also refers to Tommo
            and his host family, which suggests Tommo's growing
            sense of acceptance in the community. Probably in a still
            later proofreading phase, after making changes in RS11ms50,
            HM returned to “faint shouts” and inserted an <hi rend="italics">a</hi> before the phrase, intending “a
            faint shout” (which is, in fact, the English edition
            reading). However, HM did not cancel the <hi rend="italics">s</hi> in “shouts,” so the inscription appears to be “a
            faint shouts” [6]. HM's subsequent use of the
            pronoun “they” in the next sentence (see RS11ms50) suggests
            that he retained the notion of the plural “faint shouts” in
            completing this scene. Moreover, he maintains the plural
            when he revises “They” to “The sounds” in RS11ms50, thus
            suggesting that he continued to have “faint shouts” in mind.
            The implication, then, is that HM's alteration to
            the intended singular “a faint shout” came late in his
            tinkering at this site, and he failed to alter “shouts” or
            “The sounds” into agreement.</p>

            “The sounds” [2] and clarify the reference to “faint shouts”

            probably first noted the inexact use of “plaintively” to
            modify “tossing,” and he transposed the word by canceling
            “plaintively” as well as “tremulously” and inserting
            “plaintively” to modify “murmuring” [2]. At this time, he
            probably also inserted “bare” to modify “arms” to give “the
            gerls tossing their bare arms in the air” [3]. But at this
            time or during another proofreading phase, HM became
            dissatisfied with the sentence's still overlong
            appositional participial phrase. To revise that phrase to a
            subordinate clause, he inserted “while” in front of “the
            gerls” and changed “and murmuring” to “murmured” [4]. He
            also altered “they” (which repeats “they” in the opening
            dependent clause) to “the men” by canceling the <hi rend="italics">y</hi> in “they” and squeezing “men” to the
            right [5], thus more clearly distinguishing male and female
            roles. In the pencil substage, HM or his brother Gansevoort
            underlined “mucke moe” [6] and placed a dot in the left
            margin, perhaps to remind him to tend to the Polynesian
            spelling and additional punctuation issues. Returning later
            to the MS, he altered the underlined phrase by adding in ink
              <hi rend="italics">e</hi>'s to both words to
            render “muckee moee” [7]. Probably at the same time, he also
            inserted the <hi rend="italics">h</hi>'s in “Awa!
            Awa!” to provide a more accurate dialect sound, “Awha!
            Awha!” In addition, he added dashes around the
            girls' dialogue and put parentheses around his
            translation, canceling an extraneous dash after
          “killed!”</p>

          <p>Probably HM made the routine spelling correction of “gerls”

          <p>HM revises as he writes and recollects more accurately the
            manner in which Toby was carried back to the village. HM is
            halfway into his sentence before his recollection begins to
            waver. Initially he writes “the head falling heavyily over
            the arm of one” [step 1], and stops himself at this point
            with the idea of continuing on with something like “over the
            arm of one of the natives.” However, he revises “arm” to
            “shoulder” to render “over the shoulder” [2], but then
            canceling “over,” he also inserts “against the breast
            &amp; shoulder” [3]. But this is not satisfactory
            either, and he subsequently cancels “&amp; shoulder” for
            his final depiction “against the breast of one” [4]. In
            addition HM also reconceived Toby's carrier as not
            just any native, but the foremost native; thus, he cancels
            “one” and continues on to complete his sentence with “the
            foremost while the lower limbs hung druping across the arms
            of the other” [5].</p>

            of my companion” (perhaps by an editor), “born between two
            natives” was altered to “borne between two men” (no doubt in
            keeping with the distinction made between men and girls in
            the previous sentence), “the head falling” became “the head

            corrected it by canceling “heart” and inserting “breast”

            referred to the unconscious Toby as “form” and “body.” Here,
            “the prostrate form” establishes an alternating pattern, but
            in his fair-copy stage, HM revised the phrase to “Toby” [3],

            earlier in his text, HM may have decided to eliminate the
            redundancy by revising “Transported at this discovery” to
            “Overjoyed at this” [3]. Chances are the routine shift from

            condition. Initially he inscribes “while a young gerl at his
            head kept fanning hims” and stops himself with a false start
            on “himself,” writing only “hims” [step 1]. Canceling the

            of his sentence with “his parched lips &amp; beaded
            brow” [4]. Perhaps upon completion of the sentence or in a
            later proofreading phase, he reduced “his parched lips
            &amp; beaded brow” to simply “his brow” [5]. However, in

            thought, inscribing only “Old Tinor, the mother of my
            servitor, now appeared with” [step 1]. Canceling “with,” he
            continues on with a different strategy, writing “holding in

            two hours” [step 1]. Moreover, he is tinkering again with
            time issues: he stops himself at “two hours,” cancels
            “hours” the moment he writes it, and continues on with “two
            or three hours,” etc. [2]. In a later proofreading phase,
            coordinated with changes in RS11ms78, he found a repetition
            of “nearly fatal,” and after temporarily removing and
            restoring the earlier “nearly fatal” in the previous
            sentence, decided to revise “nearly fatal adventure” in the

            “had” to modulate his tense to a narrative mode, thus
            rendering “the circumstances that had attended it” [3]. In a
            different proofreading phase, HM returned to the beginning
            of his sentence and inserted the “of” he had neglected to
            inscribe during his initial inscription [4]. It seems likely
            that he did this later in the process, rather than at the
            moment of initial inscription, because “of” and its

            precisely clarifies (for himself, if not finally the reader)
            his role as narrator and dramatizer. The problem that
            necessitates some kind of statement about memory and
            storytelling here is that he cannot remember the actual
            words his friend Toby spoke on that fateful day, so he must,
            as a writer, fabricate. But HM also feels obliged to confess
            or explain his fabrication to readers. Eventually he
            conceals that confession by removing the sentence
            altogether. But in trying to find the right wording for what
            he is doing as a writer, HM also records his growing sense
            of the power of an artist as an agent of “unity.”</p>
          <p>The implicit question behind the revisions in both versions
            of this sentence is what mode of fabrication will Melville
            use? In the first, canceled version, he will “relate”
            Toby's adventure in his own “language,” but put
            those words in Toby's mouth. That is, he will
            perform a kind of ventriloquism. But in the second, revised,
            uncanceled version HM makes a couple of important
            transformations; rather than “relate” the story himself, he
            will “permit” Toby to “relate” it, or rather (HM corrects
            himself) “<hi rend="italics">rehearse</hi> his own
            adventure.” And HM will have Toby do so in “language that
            most readily occurs to [Melville].” The suggestion is that,
            in composing the scene, HM will become the character of Toby
            rather than simply speak for him. This is, in effect, a
            dramatized self-projection rather than ventriloquism.
            Moreover, the “rehearsal” HM is proposing is similar to the
            kind of oral rehearsing of his own adventures he had
            performed for family and friends in the months before he
            began to write.</p>
          <p>HM initially wrote out the first sentence in full, with
            only the false start “in the same.” He writes, “As I cannot
            remember the words made use of by Toby on this occasion, I
            shall accordingly relate his adventure in my own language
            tho’ in the same” [step 1], thinking to conclude his
            sentence with something like “in the same manner as Toby,”
            but he cancels that thought and finishes with “putting the
            words in his mouth” [2]. However, he emphatically cancels
            the entire sentence [3], drawing a distinctive wavy line
            over his straight line cancellations, and attempts a new
            version. In composing his new sentence, HM first writes
            “Though I can not recall to reccolection” [4] and pauses,
            not to correct his misspelling of “recollection,” but to
            remove its redundancy with “recall,” and continues on with
            “mind anything like the precise phraseology employed on this
            occasion” and into his main clause, “I shall still permit my
            companion to relate” [5]. However, he stops there,
            immediately revises “relate” to “rehearse,” and finishes his
            sentence with “rehearse his own adventure in the language
            that most readily occurs me” [6]. He does not fail to see
            his inadvertent omission of “to” in the final phrase, and
            thus cancels “me” and inserts “to me” next to it to complete
            the sentence [7].</p>
          <p>HM continued on with his narrative and let this sentence
            sit for a while until the pencil substage when either he or
            his brother Gansevoort placed a dot in the margin next to
            this line. Later, HM returned to the site, canceled “still,”
            and above it inserted “still for the sake of unity” [8],
            thereby explicitly establishing his artistic license for the
            new kind of fabrication he is up to. That is, HM will not
            only adopt the role of Toby but do so in order to make the
            scene work with the rest of the narrative in a unified way.</p>
          <p>This passage is the earliest recorded instance of
            HM's acknowledgment of himself as a self-conscious
            artist. Given the significant amount of subsequent revision
            HM made to Toby's dialogue, both in the MS and
            later in the fair-copy stage, we can readily conclude that
            HM's struggle to actualize Toby as a character and
            capture his idiom in this scene was the trigger for the
            passage and HM's deeper self-awareness. In short,
            coming to terms with how to render Toby dramatically
            amounted to the same issue as coming to terms with creating
            a unified narrative. Moreover, the fact that HM's
            “unity” insertion came in a late substage of revision
            indicates that the writer came to his aesthetic idea of
            unity only after he had performed a good deal of work on the
            Toby dialogue itself. That is, his understanding of a sense
            of artistic unity derived from his having to deal with the
            problem of how to characterize Toby.</p>

          <p>Significantly HM's unity sentence does not appear

          <p>HM tinkered with his Polynesian spelling after completing
            the MS, and on the back cover of the folder he used to hold
            MS chapters 10-12, he scribbled several versions of the name
            “Maheyo” [step 1], including “Marheyoo,” “Marheeyo,” and the
            word he finally settled upon, “Marheyo.” Since the front of
            this cover bears the inscription “First Draught of ‘Typee’ —
            After which much was added &amp; altered,” it is safe to
            assume that the trial versions of “Marheyo” on the back, and
            much of HM's revision of his Polynesian words came
            extremely late in the process. In any event, the shift to
            “Marheyo” [2] was not done by an editor. The alteration of
            “began” to “said,” however, may have been the routine work
            of HM's English editor.</p>

          <p>HM seems to be composing as he writes. He moves along

            Maheyo informed me lay the valley of Hapaa &amp; along
            their summits &amp; skirting the head of the vale la”
            [step 1], but stopping himself in the middle of the word
            “lay.” Recognizing that he has already used the verb in the
            sentence, he cancels the false start “la” and finishes up
            with “was my route to Nuheva” [2]. In a proofreading phase,
            HM made several minor revisions. He inserted an
            uncapitalized “just” at the beginning of the sentence [3],
            and to eliminate the repetition of “Maheyo,” he revised the
            name to “my guide” [4]. With the elimination of redundancy
            also in mind, he converted his first ampersand to “while”
            [5].</p>

          <p>In a proofreading phase, HM revised “only mid way” [step 1]
            to “a little way” [2]. The revision has a subtle but real
            effect. The “only” in “only mid way” implies that Toby had
            anticipated that Marheyo would accompany him much further;
            whereas the more objective “little way” conveys no sense of
            disappointment. This change is significant given the
            possibility that the Typees (not Happars) might have
            actually orchestrated the coming attack on Toby as a means
            of dissuading him and Tommo from leaving. While HM never
            articulates this possibility, the implications are embedded
            in the text, especially when seen in the light of the
            Typees' phony attack on Toby in his second and
            successful escape as related in “The Story of Toby” (written
            after the publication of the first English and American
            editions, but included in the American Revised edition).
            Here the removal of “only” effectively buries a bit of
            evidence that Marheyo may be complicit in a staged attack on
            Toby. (See also RN11ms87.)</p>

          <p>HM stops himself as he writes to tinker with prepositions.
            He initially writes “he was unwilling to approach nearer the
            territories of” [step 1], but pauses here, inserting “to”
            for the first time to give “nearer to the territories of”
            [2], but before going on he also decides to intensify
            Marheyo's reluctance to continue with Toby: Marheyo
            is now “afraid to approach alone” [3]. The revision of
            “unwilling” to “afraid” supplies more reason for
            Marheyo's abandonment of Toby and heightens the
            suspense of the coming attack on Toby. But if the attack is
            a staged affair, with Typee natives pretending to be
            belligerent Happars, Marheyo's fear might be part
            of the staging. On the other hand, Marheyo is old, docile,
            and eccentric, and may not be in on the scheme (if such it
            is), in which case his fear would be genuine. These
            potentialities, while embedded in the texts of both the
            MS and first English edition, are never fully articulated by
            HM. (See also RS11ms83.) Unfortunately, the insertion of the
            intensifier “alone” creates the awkward phrasing of “alone
            nearer to” and forces further revision. HM cancels “nearer
            to” [4] and then finding himself in need of fresh space
            cancels “the territories of” as well [5]. Beginning again
            with the new approach of “any nearer,” he finishes off his
            sentence and continues on to his next main clause with “he
            was afraid to approach alone any nearer to the territories
            of the enemies of his tribe, he however,” etc. [6]. In a
            proofreading phase, he returned to the sentence to fret
            again over “nearer to,” which just does not sound right. He
            canceled the “to,” thus returning his phrasing to “any
            nearer the territories” [7], and perhaps at the same time,
            noticed that his inserted word “alone” needs to be more
            clearly positioned. He canceled that word [8] and
            repositioned it by inserting it over “any nearer” [9]. But
            the repositioning, while it did not change the phrasing,
            only underscored the awkwardness of the phrase “alone any
            nearer the territories,” so he reinserted “to” as well to
            render “alone any nearer to the territories” [10]. Finally
            HM discovered that, in the haste of composition, he had run
            his sentences together. He corrected the error, either
            immediately or in a later proofreading phase, by inscribing
            a capital <hi rend="italics">H</hi> over the lowercase <hi rend="italics">h</hi> in “he” [11] to signal a new
            sentence. He, however, failed to convert the comma to a
            period.</p>

            “hastily” [3], apart from allowing HM to avoid having to

            probably intending nothing more than “such a great

            his introductory participial phrase with “so great a
            reputation for mildness &amp; humanity” [2]. In a
            proofreading phase, he squeezed the word “close” into the
            left margin just before “vicinity” [3]. The revision reveals
            that HM had not, at this point, fully mastered his rendering
            of Toby's dialogue. As it stands in MS, the
            dialogue is quite literate and so lacking in colloquialisms
            and the rhythm of speech that it may be called stiff. The
            shift from “vicinity” to “close vicinity” only adds to the
            stiffness.</p>

          <p>The revisions here show how HM's memory and the
            layering of sentence structure work side by side. Initially
            the earlier sentence ended with “&amp; soon gained
            it's top.” HM then goes on in a new sentence to
            describe the view: “The summit ran tapered almost to a
            point” [step 1]. But he gets no further than “point” before
            deciding to cancel the redundant “almost to a point” and
            goes on with “up into” [2], probably intending something
            like “The summit ran tapered up into the sky.” Perhaps
            recognizing that “summits” are generally tapered and do not
            “run,” he immediately cancels that thought by striking over
            the entire line, including the previously canceled “almost
            to a point.” Rethinking his recollected image and newly
            forming sentence structure, he revises “top” in the previous
            sentence to “summit” and continues on recasting his thought
            now as a barely grammatical, extended participial phrase
            “tapered up to a sharp ridge.” He also moves on to another
            modifying clause “from whence I beheld the two vallies of
            Tippii &amp;” [3]. At this point, his intention is to
            write something like “the two vallies of Tippii &amp;
            Happaa,” but the dramatic point here is the hostility of the
            tribes. He immediately cancels “vallies of Tippii &amp;”
            and finishes his sentence with “hostile vallies reposing at
            its base on either side of me” [4]. The emphasis on
            hostility raises an ambiguity: are the tribes hostile to
            each other only, or to Toby as well? Certainly the Happaa
            tribesmen he is about to meet prove not so friendly to him.
            But has he identified them correctly as Happaas? It is
            entirely plausible that the Typees themselves are pretending
            to attack Toby to drive him back to the Typee valley. A
            similar ruse is reported in “The Story of Toby,” the
            book's sequel, which relates Toby's second
            and successful attempt at escape. (See also RN11ms83 and
            84.) Upon completion of this overly long construction, or
            perhaps in a later proofreading phase, he realized the need
            to refashion his single sentence into two. To do this he
            returned to the word “tapered” and squeezed “It” in front of
            it to create a clause (“It tapered,” etc.) out of the
            participial phrase [5]. A second scenario for the placement
            of “It” is that HM did not attempt the over-extended
            participial phrase in the first place, but conceived of two
            sentences at the time he converted “top” to “summit” [in
            step 3]. And, in his haste, he simply left out the “It,”
            which he later on squeezed in. (This is plausible because in
            revising “top” to “summit,” he would have had the latter
            word in mind and could have easily forgotten the need to
            restate “summit” as the pronoun “It.”)</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage or perhaps in the preparation of the
            English edition, HM or an editor revised the two sentences
            further [6]. The strategies behind two of the changes are
            not entirely clear. HM deleted “rigorously” from “I
            rigorously pushed up the acclivity,” perhaps to lower
            Toby's diction (although one would think
            “acclivity” would have received a similar fate). And while
            altering “the two hostile valleys” to “both the hostile
            valleys,” he also removed “reposing at its base on either
            side of me,” which is a useful phrase succinctly describing
            Toby's perch above and between the two valleys.
            Presumably HM felt the picture was clear enough without the
            phrase. The third change, from “it's” to “its,” is
            purely mechanical [RS11e117]. HM and many writers of his day
            (as well as today) make this error; even so, HM generally
            inscribes the proper spelling. But if he did not correct it,
            an editor surely did.</p>

          <p>The baseline cancellation of “myself” suggests two
            possibilities. It is plausible that HM initially wrote out
            both “myself's” [step A1], but upon proofreading
            discovered the redundancy, and canceled the first “myself”
            [A2]. More likely, however, is that as he composes, he stops
            at “&amp; rested myself” [B1], immediately cancels
            “myself,” and continues on with “for a moment refreshing
            myself,” etc. [B2]. In either case, HM makes another
            inscription error. As he writes, he inadvertently repeats an
            unnecessary “of” [step A1 or B2]. The error occurs as he
            decides to revise from “of the cocoanuts” to “of my
            cocoanuts,” but in canceling “of,” he neglects to cancel
            “the” and continues on with “my cocoanuts,” thus leaving “of
            the my cocoanuts” [3]. This is an oversight that he fails to
            correct in the subsequent proofreading phases in which he
            returned to the sentence to insert “Here” at the beginning
            [4] and revise “from the contents” to “with the contents”
            [5].</p>

          <p>Perhaps because the phrase “with the contents of the
            cocoanuts” is overly descriptive, HM, in his fair-copy
            stage, simply eliminated “with the contents of” and at the
            same time no doubt corrected “the my cocoanuts” to “my
            cocoanuts” to render what appears in the English edition as
            “with my cocoa nuts” [6]. (The spelling of cocoanut as one

          <p>HM seems to be composing fresh material as he writes. Here,
            first inscribing “Starting up again, I I” [step 1], he
            inadvertently repeats “I” but immediately corrects the error
            by writing “was” over “I” and continuing on with his
            sentence. However, inscribing “path of” [2] for “path ahead
            of me,” he gets ahead of himself. Noticing the false start,
            he immediately cancels “of,” and continues to the end of his
            sentence: “ahead of me who must have just come out of the
            Hapaa valley” [3]. In the pencil substage, HM or his brother
            Gansevoort discovered that the <hi rend="italics">who</hi>-
            clause and participial phrase in the sentence appear in
            reverse order, thus creating a misplaced modifier. (That is,
            “who must have just come out of the Hapaa valley”
            erroneously modifies “me” rather than “natives.”) To mark
            the error, someone put a dot beside the line in the left
            margin [4]. To correct the error, HM returned to the spot at
            a later time and underscored both sentence parts in ink,
            placing two small <hi rend="italics">2</hi>'s
            beneath the phrase and two small <hi rend="italics">1</hi>'s beneath the clause to indicate their
            proper sequencing [5]. (For a similar pattern of revision,
            see RS10ms3 and RS11ms65.) It is this transposing of
            sentence elements that probably triggered HM's
            shift from “native” to “islander.” Here as elsewhere, HM
            plays with his terms for denominating Toby's
            adversaries. (For other revisions involving native,
            islander, and savage, see RN11ms93, 96, 98, and 106.)
            Initially the men are “three natives.” Chances are HM first
            altered “natives” to “islanders” [6] to give “three
            islanders” and then inserted “of these” [7] as a second
            thought, either immediately or at a later point. This
            likelihood is supported by the fact that “of these” is
            squeezed into the little available space in front of the
            inserted “islanders.” But since there is no antecedent for
            “these,” this designation is puzzling. Either it is an
            inadvertency, or HM is having Toby use “these” colloquially
            as in “There were these here islanders.” In any event, HM
            converted “these” into “the” by simply striking out the “se”
            in “these” [8].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM revised the opening of his
            sentence by eliminating “Starting up again” and converting
            it to the adverb in “I was soon again pursuing” [9]. In this
            stage he may have also corrected the spelling of “height.”
            The dropping of “the” in “the Happar valley” to give “Happar
            valley” is curious. The former expression appears twice in
            the novel; the latter only once, in the present sentence.
            This latter usage suggests a formal name for the area rather
            than the general designation of “the Happar valley.” Perhaps
            HM intended “Happar valley” as Toby's special
            usage; or perhaps the omission of “the” was inadvertent in
            the fair-copy stage, or even in the preparation of the

          <p>HM is composing fresh material throughout this episode. His
            first thought in crafting this sentence is to describe the
            tribesmen beckoning Toby. He tries this in two forms: “They
            beckoned me toward them” [step 1], and then canceling
            “toward them,” he tries “They beckoned me to approach” [2].
            He then cancels “beckoned me” and “to approach” in separate
            strokes, leaving only “They” [3], with perhaps the idea of
            trying “approach” yet again, but he cancels the thought,
            saving it for two sentences later, and goes on to describe,

            “I advanced towards … he hauled off like lightning with his
            weapon” [step 1] — without a false start or cancellation.
            However, in a proofreading phase, he inserted “almost” [2]

            may have corrected the spelling of “angrily.” And he
            tightened the image of “he hauled off like lightning with
            his weapon” to “he wheeled round his weapon like lightning.”
            (The reading “hauled” is a conjecture. The word looks more
            like “haild” with an undotted “i”; it might also be
            “hurled.”) To “haul off” is a nautical term for turning a
            ship around, and may be the usage HM thought fitting for the
            sailor Toby to use. The equally colloquial “wheeled round”
            may have been selected for the sake of landlubbers.</p>

          <p>HM begins his sentence on the previous MS page 17 with
            “When the first stunning effect had subsided &amp; I
            became restored to consciousness I perceived the three
            savages standing a little distance from” [step 1] but stops
            at the word “from” probably intending “from me.” Canceling
            “from,” he revises to “off” (to give “a little distance
            off”) and finishes his sentence with “&amp; seemingly
            engaged in some violant altercation respecting me” [2]. In a
            proofreading phase, HM once again opted for the more neutral
            descriptor, calling his three assailants “islanders” rather
            than “savages” [3]. Given the violence against him, Toby
            might be justified in using “savages,” but HM is also wary
            of limiting his use of the word. In a subsequent revision
            ten lines down (see RS11ms96), he alters savages to “my
            enemies”; however, in RS11ms98 he revises “islanders” to
            “savages,” which is the only appearance of that word in this
            particular scene. (See also RS11ms93 and 106.) Perhaps at
            the same time, HM also tinkered with the opening of his
            sentence by canceling “I became” and inserting “left me,” a
            revision that renders the shaky phrase “&amp; left me
            restored to consciousness” [5]. But apparently HM was not
            satisfied with the admittedly odd expression of “left me
            restored,” and in the pencil substage, he or Gansevoort
            noted the problem area with a penciled dot in the right
            margin. Later, HM returned to revise in ink. He canceled the
            entire <hi rend="italics">when</hi>- clause in one pen
            stroke that jumps over the already canceled “I became” to
            include the insertion “left me.” He then inserted, down the
            left-hand margin, the neatly inscribed substitution, “As
            soon as I regained my consciousness” [6]. A single wavy
            insertion line over the canceled word “consciousness” points
            to the left-margin insertion.</p>

            stage [3]. The sequence of changes cannot be determined, but
            to create his revision HM made four kinds of changes. 1) He
            converted his complex sentence to a compound-complex
            sentence, 2) by changing his introductory phrase, “The next
            moment without looking backward,” to a main clause, “I had
            no need to look behind me.” 3) He also lowered
            Toby's diction in the second main clause by
            revising “I became sensible” to simply “I knew.” 4) And with
            a similar view in mind, he tinkered with certain words,
            deleting his misspelled “feindish” from “feindish yells” and
            eliminating the cliché “hot pursuit” for “full pursuit.”</p>

          <p>Initially HM wrote without revision, “Animated to madness
            by their fearful outcries, I now rushed down the mountain
            side with the speed of the wind” [step 1]. However, sometime
            later in a proofreading phase, certainly after having
            completed this manuscript page, HM made massive alterations
            to his text. After the word “outcries,” he created an
            insertion so long that it crams two lines of writing in the
            space above the baseline and continues in short, single-word
            horizontal lines down the right margin. The messiness of the
            insertion suggests that HM was making it up as he wrote and
            not copying it from other sheets of paper. Originally HM
            writes, “&amp; unheeding the injury I had receivd tho’
            the blood stang” [2], with the idea of finishing off with
            something like “tho’ the blood stang my eyes.” But he
            interrupts this idea, cancels “stang,” continues on with the
            fuller expression “tho’ the blood flowing from my wound
            trickled over into my eyes and almost blinded them” [3].
            After composing the entire insertion, HM later canceled
            “&amp; unheeding,” inserting, well to the left of that
            cancellation, the words “&amp; heedless of” [4]. The
            position of these words so far to the left suggests that HM
            was giving himself space to revise even further, but
            apparently thought better of it.</p>

          <p>HM tinkered with this heavily revised passage in his
            fair-copy stage. The biggest revision was to tone down
            “Animated to madness” to “Urged on” [5], once again
            lessening Toby's hysteria (see RN11e133 and 134).
            He also altered “my wound” to “the wound” and “blinded them”
            to “blinded me.” Finally, following a pattern of late
            revisions designed to clarify his narrative timing, he
            deleted the word “now” from “I now rushed.”</p>

          <p>HM revises a good deal as he composes, Overall he inscribes
            a compound and a compound-complex sentence separated by a
            dash, which he revises immediately as he composes [steps
            1-3], and revised again in a series of proofreading phases
            [steps 4-8]. Then in an additional proofreading phase, he
            composed a third, compound sentence to introduce the two he
            has already written, and in doing so makes a <hi rend="italics">when</hi>- clause out of the first of his
            original two sentences [steps 9-14]. The result of the heavy
            revision was a long, grammatically problematic construction
            that he later altered in his fair-copy stage [step 15].</p>
          <p>Initially HM writes “Suddenly a terrific howl burst upon my
            ear, &amp; in the same instant I instantly” [step 1],
            stopping at “instantly,” or shortly thereafter, to undo the
            repetition of “instant I instantly.” Revising “instant” to
            “moment,” he continues with Toby's description but
            stops at the word “ahead” [2]. He wants, at this point, to
            continue on with the image of the spear hitting the tree
            with such force that the spear actually quivers, but he is
            ambivalent about the placement of the tree. He cancels
            “ahead,” but soon enough gaining reassurance, he reinscribes
            “ahead” and continues on to the end of his sentence, “ahead
            where it hung quivering with the sudden resistance it had
            met” [3]. In a proofreading phase, either at the moment of
            completing this sentence or a bit later, HM made a series of
            revisions, some of the sequencing of which is fairly certain
            given the squeezings of words he had to perform. Chances are
            he began with the idea of tweaking his sentence structure by
            converting “darted” to “darting” [4], thus changing the
            compound sentence into a simple sentence with a participial
            phrase. At the same time, he probably inserted “as I fled”
            (creating now a complex sentence), but he failed to remove
            the ampersand in “&amp; stuck,” making the revision
            barely grammatical. He also returned to the word “ahead,”
            which he had previously waffled over. This time he canceled
            “ahead” (again) and inserted the words “before me” [5] above
            it and on either side of the caret used for “as I fled.”
            Either immediately or at a later point, he thought better of
            the phrase he had created, “a tree before me,” and he
            canceled “before me,” inserting “beyond” for “a tree beyond”
            [6]. HM then canceled the doubly redundant “noise in my
            ear”—noises are heard only in the ear, but also the phrase
            echoes “burst upon my ear” two lines up—as well as his
            sentence dash, replacing both phrase and dash with “noise”
            [7] and a longer dash closing the gap between “noise” and “a
            heavy javlin.” Finally, in this set of changes he inserted
            the word “almost” to give “almost in the same moment” [8] by
            drawing around it a kind of comic strip dialogue bubble that
            distinguishes the insertion from the lengthy marginal
            insertion in RS11ms97, and points to its precise place of
            insertion. With these revisions complete, the sentence (with
            its uncanceled ampersand) reads: “Suddenly a terrific howl
            burst upon my ear, &amp; almost in the same moment I
            instantly shrunk to one side from a fearful whizzing noise—a
            heavy javlin darting past me as I fled &amp; [sic] stuck
            the next moment into a tree beyond where it hung quivering
            with the sudden resistance it had met.”</p>
          <p>In a later proofreading phase performed after he had
            completed the MS page [RS11ms99], HM inserted a new opener
            for the already lengthy sentence. He composed the insertion
            directly on the MS page rather than copy it from earlier,
            separate drafts. In revising once more, he wants to convey,
            in his long sentence, a rapid succession of aural and
            physical phenomena: the running downhill, the ceasing of
            outcries, the sudden howling of the natives, and then the
            whizzing of a spear. Having already established the sudden
            burst of howling in his original sentence, he begins to add
            other introductory details of Toby's descent from
            the mountain; however, at first he writes only “In a fe” [9]
            with something in mind like “In a few moments,” etc. But as
            part of his earlier revisions to his original sentence, he
            had already revised “instant” to “moment” just one line down
            the page. To avoid a repetition, he immediately cancels
            “few” in mid-word and opts for “short time.” Continuing on,
            he completes his introductory insertion, “In a short time I
            had descended nearly half way &amp; the islanders ceased
            their cries, when” [10], but he must actually inscribe the
            latter half of this insertion down the right margin. Because
            the bubble insertion of “almost” [step 8] crowds the space
            above the baseline barely a half inch away from the words
            “&amp; the” in this insertion, HM is forced to find
            space elsewhere on the page to complete his insertion. He
            therefore rotates the leaf counterclockwise so that it is
            sideways on his desk and inscribes the latter portion of his
            insertion, “islanders ceased their cries, when,” down the
            right-hand margin. (To mark off this fragment of an
            insertion from the full insertion discussed in RS11ms97,
            which already extends down the margin, he draws a serpentine
            line around the earlier insertion, to separate the two.)
            Almost immediately, however, he thinks better of “the
            islanders”: he cancels “islanders” in the margin and “the”
            back in the first half of his insertion, and inserts “my”
            [11] directly after the canceled “the,” with the idea
            perhaps of making his subject “my enemies,” a phrase he has
            already used earlier in the narrative (see RS11ms96). But he
            quickly cancels “my,” leaving only the ampersand uncanceled.
            He then returns to the canceled word “islanders” in the
            margin and squeezes “the savages” [12] just below it, and
            draws a short line connecting “savages” to the verb
            “ceased.” Probably soon after this, he altered “ceased” to
            “ceasing” [13], creating yet another ungrammatical moment in
            the sentence. Finally, in rereading his completed sentence,
            HM tinkered with the distance Toby travels down the mountain
            by canceling “half way” and inserting “a third of the
            distance” [14]. Since “half way” is itself inserted above
            the baseline, and since he therefore has no room there to
            make his insertion, HM was forced to inscribe “a third of
            the distance” above the baseline of the preceding line. To
            mark its proper placement, he then drew another
            bubble-and-pointer around the insertion.</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM continued to revise this lengthy
            passage considerably, although the final version printed in
            the English edition remains a bit wobbly [15]. He made four
            kinds of changes, not the least of which was 1) the
            correction in two places of his shaky sentence structure. He
            did so by returning his verbs back to their original
            predicate roles: “the savages ceasing” became “the savages
            had ceased” (RN11e139), and “a heavy javlin darting” became
            “a heavy javelin darted,” with the correct spelling no doubt
            supplied by an editor (RN11e140). HM made smaller but no
            less significant changes. 2) He solved the tree positioning
            problem; having run through “ahead” (twice), “before me,”
            and “beyond,” he finally settled for the obvious “close to
            me.” 3) He also removed his unnecessary qualifier “almost”
            from “almost in the same moment.” 4) And he removed two
            clauses of relatively fine graphic description of the
            whizzing javelin: “I instantly shrunk to one side from a
            fearful whizzing noise” and “where it hung quivering with
            the sudden resistance it had met.” As early as 1820, “whizz”
            had become low London talk for noise or buzz (as in
            chatter); HM obviously uses the word onomatopoetically but
            may have thought better of the usage in light of British
            slang. (One likelihood, of course, is that an English editor
            or Gansevoort suggested the removal of “whizzing” in the
            preparation of the English edition.) The latter clause,
            “where it hung…,” is particularly effective in putting
            across the intense physical vibration of the spear, but such
            niceties were probably deemed unlikely for Toby to be making
            under the circumstances of relating his near-death
          escape.</p>

        <div id="RN11ms100-101e141" synch="RS11ms100-101e141" type="narr">
          <p>Continuing with Toby's monologue on his escape, HM
            expands the description as he writes, only later to reduce
            it. His opening gambit is marked by a series of false
            starts. Initially he writes “Before I could rela” [step 1],
            a false start on “realize,” which HM cancels as soon as he
            begins to inscribe it. He then continues on with “Before I
            could realize the” [2], probably with something like “the
            narrowness of my escape” or “the peril I was in” in mind. At
            this point, while cogitating a more direct expression of
            this phrasing, he may have also inserted “fully” to give
            “Before I could fully realize the” [3]. (The reasoning here
            is that the inking of “fully” is the same as that of the
            words below it, suggesting the possibility of an immediate
            inscription.) Whether he makes the insertion of “fully” at
            this time or not, he does immediately cancel “the,”
            converting it to the more direct “my narrow escape,” and
            continues on with his sentence: “my narrow escape, another
            yell followed by the same whizzing sound, and a second spear
            &amp; a third shot through the air and, I” [4]. Stopping
            at this point, his impulse seems to be to move directly to
            record Toby's desire to continue running,
            eventually expressed a few lines down (“I continued my
            descent”). But instead, he immediately cancels the “and, I”
            in order to expand on the spears, with his “one of them
            glancing … &amp; the other piercing” parallel structure
            [5]. The expansion on the errant spears may have in turn
            inspired him to articulate, in the following two sentences,
            the natives' rage, disappointment, and retreat, as
            well as Toby's gratitude to Providence. In any
            event, having completed the present sentence, he may have
            returned, either at this time or in a later proofreading
            phase, to the words “through the air” and inserted “on
            either side of me” [6] to clarify the closeness of his peril
            [RN11ms101].</p>

          <p>HM made considerable cuts to this sentence in his fair-copy

            Toby's “narrow escape,” and since he had eliminated
            the “whizzing noise” of the spear in RS11e140, he also
            removed “by the same whizzing sound.” A third set of
            revisions eliminates the “glancing” of one spear against a
            rock, substitutes “within a few feet of my body” for the
            previously inserted “on either side of me,” and makes both
            spears pierce the ground. This massive reduction of detail
            shortens the sentence and no doubt heightens the urgency of
            the scene, but at the expense of some particularly harrowing
            details.</p>

          <p>Once again HM seems to be composing fresh material, and at
            one point interrupts himself in order to expand on details
            that are later reduced. The sentence stumbles at first with
            “A simultanius of” [step 1], a false start on “A simultanius
            burst of.” HM immediately cancels “of” and continues on with
            “burst of rage &amp; disappointment now broke from the
            foiled savages of Hapaa &amp; grateful” [2]. As in
            RS11ms101, his impulse is to jump directly to
            Toby's gratitude toward Providence, and
            Toby's descent (an idea eventually expressed in the
            following sentence); however, he stops himself at “&amp;
            grateful” and cancels these words in order to describe the
            Happars' fear and withdrawal with “who fearful of
            venturing further into the Tipii valley drew off &amp;
            abandoned the chace” [3]. Later, in the pencil substage, HM
            or Gansevoort marked this passage with a dot in the right
            margin [4], and HM returned to it to elaborate in ink on the
            Happars' retreat, first adding the insertion “after
            recovering their weapons” [5] to give “drew off after
            recovering their weapons &amp; abandoned the chace.”
            Canceling “after” and the ampersand, he then added to the
            left a second insertion: “shortly after meeting with this
            repulse and” [6] to give “drew off shortly after meeting

          <p>HM revised the sentence heavily in his fair-copy stage [7]
            making at least four kinds of changes. 1) He converted his
            complex sentence to a compound sentence by turning his long,
            but well-balanced, <hi rend="italics">who</hi>- clause, “who
            fearful … drew off… and recovering … abandoned the chace,”
            into a coordinate main clause, “but they were afraid … and
            so abandoned.” He also reversed the subject and object of
            his first main clause so that “The fellows” (formerly “the
            savages”) performs the action. Similarly, his revision of
            “fearful” to “they were afraid” in the second clause makes
            for a more direct and active sentence. 2) The conversion of
            “savages” to “fellows” continues HM's pattern of
            revision in the MS of eliminating the derogatory “savage.”
            3) HM also revised “venturing” to “coming down” to lower
            Toby's diction, 4) and he eliminated the adverb
            “now” from his first clause, following once again his
            pattern of clarifying his narrative time frame.</p>

          <p>The phrasing anticipated in two preceding revision sites
            (RS11ms101 and 103), expressing Toby's gratitude
            and continued descent, finally comes in this sentence, which
            HM seems to be composing afresh. He makes two false starts.
            Initially he opens the sentence with “Gratefull to
            Providence for this signal preservation from a shocking
            death” [step 1], but stops at “death” and immediately
            cancels the presumably unnecessary “from a shocking death.”
            Quickly resuming he then writes “I continued my descent,
            renouncing all thoughts of resuming the jou” [2], stopping
            now in mid-thought, inscribing only the beginning of the
            word “journey.” His initial impulse is to end the sentence
            with “the journey,” but he immediately cancels “the jou” in
            order to expand to the more emotionally fraught “a journey
            attended by such unlooked-for perils” [3].</p>

            revising and reducing Toby's monologue. Here the
            simple sentence is cut down to a flat, coordinated clause:
            “and I continued my descent as fast as I could” [4]. All
            mention of gratitude, Providence, preservation, and peril
            has been eliminated.</p>

          <p>Beginning the concluding section of Toby's
            monologue, HM does not seem to be returning to earlier notes
            or drafts, but continues to compose afresh. This sentence
            begins with two, not entirely decipherable, false starts; at
            first, simply the letter <hi rend="italics">W</hi> [step 1],
            which he cancels, and then what appears to be an elaborately
            inscribed letter <hi rend="italics">M</hi> (or perhaps
            another <hi rend="italics">W</hi>) [2], also canceled. Quite
            possibly, HM's initial impulse is to begin with
            what he eventually uses at the end of his sentence, that is,
            “With Maheyo” or “Maheyo,” thus prioritizing
            Maheyo's presence as the trigger for the native
            hostility toward Toby. In any event, HM soon enough moves on
            with a new strategy, inscribing “What could have elicited
            the ferocious enmity of these natives I could not imagine
            without it were that they had s” [3], and stopping himself
            at the false start on the word “seen.” (In the following
            sentence, Toby uses the phrase “being seen to emerge,” and
            it may be that with this in mind HM immediately discarded
            “seen” in the present sentence to avoid an eventual
            repetition.) Canceling the <hi rend="italics">s</hi>, he
            immediately opts for the more hifalutin (but misspelled)
            “descryed” and continues on with “descryed me ascending the
            mountain with Maheyo” [4]. Either upon completion of the
            sentence, or in some later proofreading phase, HM returned
            to tinker with “the ferocious enmity of these natives.” In
            several coordinated insertions, he changed “the” to “such,”
            added “on the part,” and probably at this time revised
            “natives” to “Islanders” to give “such enmity on the part of
            these Islanders” [5]. (See RS11ms93, 96, and 98 for similar
            tinkerings with <hi rend="italics">native</hi>, <hi rend="italics">islander</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">savage</hi>.) HM may have thought better of this new
            construction the moment he performed it because he then
            returned “such” to “the” and canceled “on the part” to give
            “the ferocious enmity of these Islanders” [6]. Each of these
            changes might have been made in coordination with other
            changes on this MS page related to the word “islander.” The
            inking of a second revision indicates that it was made in a
            different proofreading phase. Here HM simply revised the
            word “without” to “unless” [7], once again modulating
            Toby's diction.</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM worked to lower Toby's
            diction [8]. He revised “elicited” to “caused” and “enmity”

            the conversion of “descryed” to his original thought “seen”
            [RN11e145]; however, it is also possible that this revision
            was made in coordination with the revision in the following
            line of “being seen to emerge” to “coming from” (see
            RS11e147). The change to “attack” surely triggered the
            revision of “the” (formerly “such”) to “this.” And by
            revising “Islanders” to “Happars,” he was able to give the
            needed distinctive designation to his attackers.</p>

            extensive changes [2]. Given that in RS11e145, he had
            changed “descryed” to “seen,” he no doubt felt obliged to
            eliminate the resultant repetition of “seen” here; thus he
            converted “being seen to emerge” to simply “coming.” (Of
            course, in either case, the omission of “my,” as in “my
            being seen” or “my coming,” creates a grammatical
            ambiguity.) Second, the clause “in their breasts the
            bitterness of hatred they had manifested” is reduced to
            simply “them,” no doubt, once again, to lower

          <p>HM composes three sentences with relative ease, but rejects
            the entire passage in his fair-copy stage. Initially he was
            ambivalent about his opening gambit. Already in the
            preceding sentence, he had begun with “What” (wrestling
            then, too, with the word; see RS11ms106), and possibly he
            was not happy starting a second sentence in the same way. He
            inscribes the first half of “What,” but stops in mid-word
            [step 1]. Canceling the false start “Wh,” he resolves to go
            ahead with “What,” finishes that sentence and moves on to
            the second, stopping at “had been”: “What a merciful
            deliverance had I experienced! The missiles of these savages
            had been”[2]. Here HM's idea is to say something
            like “The missiles of the savages had been darted on the
            run,” but he cancels that approach in mid-thought, opting
            for a participial phrase. He cancels “had been” and then
            continues with “though darting” [3], but realizing the need
            here for a past, not present, participle, he immediately
            cancels “darting” and replaces it with “darted” [4]; he then
            continues with “darted on the run” and the rest of his
            sentence. In a proofreading phase (although possibly during
            composition), HM canceled the “se” in “these” to render “the
            savages” [5], thus creating a slight diminution of the
            derogation “these savages.”</p>

            revisions and cuts cannot be determined, and the reason for
            the deletion can only be speculative. One thought is that
            the removal of “deliverance” in the first sentence is in
            keeping with the removal of “Gratefull to Providence” found
            a few lines up the MS page. Perhaps having gained his more
            irreligious mood in the later stages of composition, HM was
            not willing to evoke such sentiments or, at the very least,
            have his mercurial Toby express them. Or he may simply have
            been exasperated by the repetition of <hi rend="italics">What</hi>- sentences. Or turning to the other sentences,
            he may have felt that the nicety of detail, under the
            circumstances, did not contribute to the urgency of
            Toby's speech.</p>

          <p>HM completes the introductory participial phrase of his
            sentence, but comes to a false start in executing his main
            clause, writing only “Stimulated by the danger that had
            menaced me, I had scarcely ex” [step 1] with the idea of
            saying something like “I had scarcely ex” He cancels “ex”
            and, using a caret for each word, inserts “felt” and
            “sensible” around the word “scarcely,” and then finishes the
            sentence: “I had felt scarcely sensible of the wound I
            received—but now that the excitement of the chace was over I
            began to experience its effects” [2]. In a late proofreading
            phase, after he had inserted his paragraph marks, and
            sensing both a verb tense problem and a misplaced adverb, he
            toyed around with “had,” first canceling it to give “I felt
            scarcely sensible” [3]. Then canceling “scarcely,” he
            squeezed the same word in front of the already inserted
            “felt” and canceled his first caret mark to render “I
            scarcely felt sensible” [4]. He then restored “had” (in
            print letters) below the already canceled “had” (perhaps at
            this time restoring the canceled caret as well) for “I
            scarcely had felt sensible” [5]. Finally, without canceling
            the lower “had,” he squeezed another “had” in front of the
            inserted “scarcely” for his final manuscript reading: “I had

          <p>HM seems to have composed with little or no hesitation
            [step 1]; however, his cancellation of the ampersand in
            “&amp; my temples” poses a couple of problems. The
            seemingly clumsy succession of ampersands in the second
            sentence suggests that HM may have been composing fresh
            material. But this clumsiness may have been intended so that
            Toby is made to speak his sequence of coordinate clauses
            with a breathless repetition of “and” (“A confused ringing
            sound was … and my temples throbbed … and a general
            faintness seized”), and this would argue for an artistically
            planned breathlessness, hence the possibility that HM was
            not composing afresh but actually copying from earlier notes
            or drafts. The question, then, is how HM came to cancel his
            ampersand in “&amp; my temples.” He may have canceled it
            while or after he composed, recognizing then repairing the
            clumsiness of his sentence. Or he may have canceled it while
            or after he copied, changing his mind about Toby's
            breathless delivery. Moreover, the question of when HM
            deleted the ampersand (during or after initial inscription)
            remains uncertain. The fact that the deletion of the
            ampersand creates a run-on sentence, which HM made no
            attempt on the MS page to correct (either by punctuation or
            capitalization) suggests the idea that HM deleted the
            ampersand as soon as he wrote it rather than in a later
            proofreading phase when, with more deliberation, he would
            have been able to correct the sentence error. Even so, the
            more likely scenario is that HM did cancel the ampersand in
            a proofreading phase in order to create a series of clauses,
            and an even more breathless delivery as in “sound was …
            temples throbbed … &amp; … faintness seized,” but he
            simply forgot to supply the requisite comma [2]. There is no
            doubt, however, that HM returned in a proofreading phase to
            the end of his first sentence in order to insert a modifying
            clause. The neatness of this lengthy insertion suggests that
            he is copying from a version drafted on separate and
            discarded paper. Even so, he stumbles or revises as he
            copies. He begins by inscribing “that glared intensely upon
            the unf” [3], probably with the idea of using the word
            “unforested.” Canceling the false start “unf,” he continues
            with “partly unwooded hill side I was descending” [4] to
            complete the insertion modifying “sun”: “that glared
            intensely upon the partly unwooded hill side I was
            descending.”</p>

          <p>HM revised and cut this passage considerably in his
            fair-copy stage [5]. Chances are the excessive detail, more
            in keeping with a third person narrator, perhaps, than with
            the speech of someone relating a near-fatal adventure,
            triggered the massive reduction. To begin with, HM removed
            “my shoes &amp;” from “my shoes &amp; hat,” which
            focuses attention more on Toby's bare head.
            Similarly, a second group of revisions led to the removal of
            HM's carefully inserted clause concerning the
            scorching rays and unwooded hill side in favor of the more
            direct “the sun scorched my bare head.” Finally, the
            confused sound and throbbing temples in HM's
            breathless series of clauses were sacrificed in favor of a
            more succinct version of “a general faintness seized hold of
            me” in the single clause “I felt faint and giddy;” which,
            ending in a semicolon, is now connected to the sentence that
            follows it.</p>

          <p>HM revises as he composes, reducing his text considerably
            in the fair-copy stage. He begins with the idea of writing
            something like “Fearful of a fall,” but inscribes only
            “Fearful of a” [step 1]. Canceling the false start “a” by
            inscribing “falling” over it, he continues on inadvertently
            miswriting “nw” for “now,” and stopping with “staggered”
            [2]. He then begins to tinker with the placement of “now” in
            “I now staggered.” He first cancels the “nw” and hastily
            inscribes or begins to inscribe “now” (the word actually
            looks like “on”) after “staggered” to give “I staggered now”
            [3]. But quickly rethinking “I staggered now,” he cancels
            his second “now” and restores the first “now” by squeezing a
            now-legibly inscribed word “now” in the margin to the right
            of it, thus returning to “I now staggered” [4]. He then
            continues with “I now staggered on as well as I was able
            &amp; beat my tottering steps toward the stream which
            flows near the base of the mountain, hoping to meet” [5].
            Revising as he writes, HM attempts to expand his sentence
            with a participial phrase, something like “hoping to meet
            friendly natives,” but this essentially repeats an idea
            already established in “beyond the reach of assistance”
            found in the previous sentence. He decides against the
            phrase in mid-thought and cancels the three words, failing
            to convert the comma to a period. He then moves on to
            complete the next sentence in its entirety: “My faintness
            increased upon me however as I advanced, &amp; just as I
            approached its banks my knees refused to support me
            &amp; I sunk unconsciously to the ground” [6]. In a
            proofreading phase (perhaps at the same time as the
            insertion at RS11ms111, steps 3-4), HM added more detail by
            inserting “gaining the level of valley” after the ampersand
            in “as I was able &amp;” to give “I now staggered on as
            well as I was able &amp; gaining the level of the valley
            beat my tottering steps toward the stream,” etc. [7].</p>

          <p>HM cut this passage down considerably in his fair-copy
            stage [8]. He reduced his two sentences (a long, simple
            sentence and a compound-complex sentence) to a
            compound-complex sentence sandwiched between two semicolons.
            He added “but” to the beginning of this new sentence and
            removed “insensible &amp;,” thus tying the sentence to
            the preceding one and lowering Toby's diction a
            bit. Also, in keeping with his practice in this stage of
            eliminating the word “now” to clarify his narrative time
            frame, he removed the previously repositioned “now” from “I
            now staggered.” He tightened “I was able” to “I could” and
            converted “gaining” to “at last gained,” giving a bit more
            finality to Toby's return. Finally, he removed
            “beat my tottering steps toward the stream which flows near
            the base of the mountain” as well as the clause relating his
            “faintness” and shaky “knees.” In this same sentence he
            reduced “&amp; I sunk unconsciously to the ground” to
            simply “and then down I sunk.” In this massive cut, HM has
            effectively removed Toby's destination (“the
            stream”) letting only “the level of the valley” stand as the
            place where he is found unconscious. At RS11e162-163, he
            made a similar cut revising “the stream” to a place where
            fuel is gathered. Apparently, HM had had Toby enact a false
            memory, which upon further reflection during the writing
            process, HM was able to recall more clearly and revise
            accordingly.</p>

          <p>Initially HM writes “I knew nothing more after this until I
            was brought to” [step 1],” intending either the colloquial
            “brought to” or the fuller expression “brought to
            consciousness.” He immediately cancels “was brought to,”
            revises it to “became sensible” and continues on to the end
            of the sentence: “became sensible that you were standing
            over me with the calabash of water” [2]. In a proofreading
            phase, HM gave himself enough space above the baseline to
            inscribe an insertion that could stretch across almost the
            entire width of the page, suggesting that he had a much
            longer insertion in mind (like that found at RS11ms111) than
            he finally came up with, or perhaps that he was allowing
            himself room to compose and revise the insertion as he
            wrote. The latter became the case. He first inscribes the
            ungrammatical “laying upon” [3], which he cancels.
            Immediately reinscribing these two words, he continues on
            with “laying upon these matts” [4]. In a separate
            proofreading phase, HM revised “became sensible” to “became
            conscious” [5].</p>

        <div id="RN11e159" synch="RS11ms117-118e159" type="narr">
          <p>HM made at least four sets of changes in his fair-copy
            stage to modify his sentence in significant ways [6]. 1) To
            begin with, he combined his sentence with the already
            lengthy, preceding sentence, “I felt faint and giddy… and I
            sunk unconsciously to the ground” (see RS11e152-154), thus
            creating a massive compound joined by various conjunctions
            and semicolons. 2) He also simplified the internal sentence
            structure by converting “laying upon these matts I became
            conscious that you were standing” to “I found myself lying …
            and you stooping.” 3) In addition, he made several minor
            adjustments: He removed the narratorially unneeded “after
            this,” corrected “laying” to “lying” (although an editor may
            have done this in preparing the English edition), and he
            revised “standing over me” to the more precise “stooping
            over me.” 4) However, the most significant change is that he
            removed “I became conscious” in coordination with a chain of
            other revisions throughout Toby's speech. In
            composing Toby's speech, HM recurred frequently to
            a particularized set of “sensibility and consciousness”
            words to relate the effects of Toby's head wound:
            “laid me senseless” (RS11e124), “regained my consciousness”
            (ms93e126), “became sensible” (e134), “scarcely felt
            sensible” (ms110e149), “falling to the ground insensible”
            (ms114), “sunk unconsciously” (ms116), and, at the present
            site, both “became sensible” then “became conscious.” This
            recurrence indicates, at the very least, HM's early
            focus on mind and the dichotomy between awareness and
            unconsciousness. And yet in his fair-copy stage, HM
            ruthlessly expunged all instances of this pattern in
            Toby's speech, substituting more concrete usages,
            such as “took away my senses,” “came to myself,” “I knew,”
            “scarcely felt.” No doubt the revisions reduce an
            overbearing redundancy in the pattern, make the abstract
            mental condition more concrete, lower Toby's
            diction, and enhance the urgency of the moment. The loss of
            HM's “sensibility and consciousness” words may be
            lamented, but his strategy of substitution is, finally, more
            revealing. In choosing expressions like “took away my
            senses,” “came to myself,” and, in the present instance, “I
            found myself” instead of “I became sensible” or “conscious,”
            HM stresses removal, discovery, arrival, and selfhood rather
            than mere sense and sensibility.</p>

          <p>HM did not alter this flat, indeed cumbersome
            sentence—“Such was the statement of Toby” [step 1]—in MS.
            However, in his fair-copy stage, he revised to
            “Toby's account of this sad affair” [2]. The
            addition of “sad affair” seems a somewhat odd description of
            the adventure considering the wildness and horror Toby
            relates. Perhaps by the time HM had worked through this
            material and his subsequent passages of guilt and remorse
            concerning his relation to Toby, he developed more of a
            sense of the sadness of Toby.</p>

            stream where the natives are accustomed to resort for the
            purpose of replenishing their bamboos with water” [step 1].
            In a proofreading phase, he added only the adjective
            “hollow” [2], to give “hollow bamboos,” which reminds

            revision; however, at some point he canceled the second. His
            first inscription is “There appeared to be no avenue opened
            to escape but that which the sea presented. And how could
            our deliverance be accomplished(?) in this quarter?” [step
            1]. (The word transcribed here as “accomplished” might also
            be “assured.”) Quite possibly HM deleted the second sentence
            as soon as he wrote it; however, he may have performed the
            deletion later in a proofreading phase. The canceled
            question itself focuses on Tommo's concern once
            again for the impossibility of an escape by water. But since
            this is, in fact, his eventual escape route, HM may have
            decided later in the process that he did not want to
            overstress its unlikelihood. Equally important is the word
            “deliverance” with its religious overtones and implicit link
            to the captivity narrative tradition. In canceling the
            question, HM removed this word as well, perhaps in keeping
            with the more advanced irreligious mood he had begun to
            develop as he wrote (see also RS11ms104-105e143 for a
            similar excision of “providence” and "preservation"). In a
            later proofreading phase, HM did in fact add an insertion.
            Giving himself ample room above the baseline, he inserted
            “washing the lower extremity of the vale” [3] to modify
            “sea”; the insertion effectively reminds readers of
            Tommo's distance from the shore.</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM made two small changes [4]. He
            inserted “our” to give “our escape,” thus emphasizing
            Toby's presence. And he eliminated his fussy “that
            which” construction by removing those words and “presented”
            to give simply “the sea washing the lower extremity of the
            vale.”</p>

          <p>HM's initial idea is to write an infinitive
            phrase, something like “&amp; to hold in striking
            contrast,” to stand in parallel with “to exhort” two lines
            up. But he changes his mind after writing “&amp; to”
            [step 1]. Canceling “&amp; to,” he opts instead for the
            participial “holding in” [2] and finishes his sentence
            misspelling “generous.” Later in a proofreading phase, he
            inserted “up” [3] to give “holding up in striking contrast.”
            In a separate proofreading phase, he canceled “vindictive”
            in “vindictive animosity” as well as “hostile” in “hostile
            neighbors” in order to insert “vindictive” as a substitute
            for “hostile” to give “the animosity evinced by their
            vindictive neighbors” [4]. (It is also possible that HM
            cancels “vindictive” the moment he writes it and makes the
            substitution with “hostile” later on.) An uncanceled caret
            mark after the word “evinced,” which has no corresponding
            insertion, might indicate an intended further expansion, or
            may be nothing more than a misplacement of the insertion
            point for “vindictive.”</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM made two sets of changes to
            tighten his sentence [5]. First, he revised “holding up in
            striking contrast to their own generus reception” to
            “contrasting their own generous reception” (perhaps
            correcting his spelling of “generous” at this time). By
            eliminating “holding up,” he also had to supply “with” in
            "with the animosity" to explain the contrast. Second, he
            also toned down the contrast by converting “animosity
            evinced by their vindictive neighbors” to simply “the
            animosity of their neighbors.”</p>

          <p>The messiness of this section alone suggests that HM was
            composing fresh material. He begins with “They likewise
            enlar” [step 1], but quickly comes to a false start on
            “enlarged.” HM cancels “enlar,” saving the word “enlarged”
            for later in the scene when we find Kory-Kory in the last
            sentence of the chapter “enlarg[ing] … upon the moral
            reflections” (RS11ms146). HM opts for “dwelt,” and continues
            on to “… &amp; disclaiming on their own part” [2]. But
            upon reaching this participial phrase, he interrupts himself
            to rethink the progress of his sentence. No doubt sensing
            that his already-lengthy sentence could not contain any more
            projected, nested clauses if he were to follow through on
            the participial phrase, he aborted that intended structure
            by canceling “&amp; disclaiming on their own part,” and
            began a new sentence, thus giving the cannibalism disclaimer
            in a full sentence of its own: “At the same time they
            earnestly disclaimed their on own part all participation in
            so horrid a custom” [3]. Later, in a proofreading phase, he
            returned to his clause, “a subject which,” etc., perhaps
            only at first to tinker with options; he canceled “subject”
            and tried out “matter” and “subject matter,” returning to
            “subject,” probably in that order [4a, b, c]. However, his
            major revision is to tone down the racial references in the
            clause. Canceling “all the inhabitants of Polynesia seem
            instinctively to understand as something that meets with
            the” and “of a white man,” he created a new reading without
            “white men”: “a subject which they were perfectly aware
            could not fail of meeting with our unutterable abhorrence”
            [5]. In the process of inscribing his insertion, he worried,
            in a series of false starts, over the right adverb to
            describe the natives' awareness: “fully understood”
            [5a], then “certainly aware” [5b], then “perfectly aware”
            [5c]. By revising “the unutterable abhorrence of a white
            man” to simply “our unutterable abhorrence,” he removed an
            initially recorded vestige of white ethnocentrism and allows
            for a more effective transition from this expression of
            cultural abhorrence to the comic scene that follows.
            Finally, HM conjoined his first revised sentence to his
            second sentence by inserting the adverb “while,” thus making
            the cannibalism disclaimer sentence a dependent clause
          [6].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM tightened the passage further
            but retained its structure [7]. He converted “their enemies”
            to “the Happars” to sharpen the contrast with the Typees at
            the beginning of the paragraph. He reduced and toned down
            his previously much longer and more hysteric <hi rend="italics">which</hi>- clause even further, by
            replacing “of meeting with our unutterable abhorrence” with
            simply “to alarm us.” And he eliminated the essentially

          <p>HM revises as he writes. He begins with “Nor did they omit
            to point out to our admiration” [step 1], with the idea
            perhaps of going on with something like “point out, to our
            admiration, the loveliness,” etc. But he cancels “point out
            to,” inserts “challenge” on the following line to give
            “challenge our admiration,” and continues on with “for the
            natural lovliness of their favored valley” [2]. In a
            proofreading phase, HM returned to tinker with “favored
            valley.” Canceling this, he inserted “beautiful abode” [3]
            above the baseline, and then canceling “beautiful,” he
            inserted “paradisical” below [4]. The sequencing of revision
            pulses between related conceptions of Eden: its status as a
            chosen place or paradise and its physical beauty. But the
            resolution of the shift to the more mythic associations must
            be seen in the context of the comic scene HM is building.
            That is, Tommo is attributing the word “paradisical” to the
            natives to express his own ironic understanding of their
            seemingly conscious exaggerations of their “abode” in
            contrast to that of the Happars.</p>

            some proofreading phase, he added a dash in front of “he
            exclaimed” [2]. The passage, however, has two potential
            problems. First, with his opening word, HM has inadvertently
            inscribed “Tipi” when in fact he means for Kory-Kory to
            refer to the Happars. Second, HM's Polynesian
            spelling is open to alternatives, and HM most certainly
            addressed this problem in his fair-copy stage; however, he
            was already, in isolated instances in the MS, revealing an
            early concern for orthography, and this site is one such
            instance. At some point HM made two ink revisions to the
            passage, and at another time, he or his brother Gansevoort
            placed a penciled dot in the margin to the right of this
            site. The penciled dot was used to indicate a problem area
            in the text that needed to be corrected in some way. But it
            is not entirely clear whether the dot refers to one problem,
            the other, or both. The exact sequencing of the revisions
            and penciled dot, then, is not certain: either he performed
            the two changes before the penciled dot was created, or they
            were made after, or one revision was performed before the
            dot, and the other after. Four scenarios are therefore
            possible.</p>
          <p>A) HM may have performed both revisions after the penciled
            dot was inserted [A3]. That is, he returned to the site and
            revised “Tipi” to “Happa,” by writing “Happa” over “Tipi,”
            and inscribed “keekeeno” below “kikino” as a tentative new
            spelling [A4]. However, HM may have revised one or the other
            in a proofreading phase before the penciled dot substage. B)
            That is, he may have revised “Tipi” to “Happa” [B3] and in
            the penciled dot substage determined a need to rethink his
            Polynesian spelling, whereupon he later on inserted the
            “keekeeno” alternative [B4]. C) Or he may have inserted the
            “keekeeno” alternative while proofreading [C3], in which
            case the penciled dot would refer to the need to revise
            “Tipi” to “Happa” [C4], which he then did later in ink. D)
            Finally, he may have both revised “Tipi” to “Happa” and
            inserted the “keekeeno” alternative [D3] in a proofreading
            phase, in which case the penciled dot [D4] would have been
            added later to remind HM to tend to the “kikino / keekeeno”
            problem, which he did not do until his fair-copy stage.</p>

            “keekeeno” alternative has been selected. At the same time,

            Hapaa valley, &amp; then running into us again with a
            rapidity that seemed to imply he was fearful we would lose
            part of his meaning before he could check the other — he”
            [step 1]. At this point HM has a long but neatly balanced
            and controlled set of compound participial phrases in
            parallel (“Having illustrated … &amp; then running”).
            After inscribing his dash, he considers moving on to his
            main clause beginning with “he,” with something in mind like
            “he proceeded to another branch of his subject,” which is in
            fact the sentence he gets to eventually. But further comic
            details of Kory-Kory's histrionics come to mind,
            and he contemplates including them in his series of
            participial phrases. He cancels “he” and “&amp; then”
            three lines up in “&amp; then running,” and adds an
            ampersand next to the canceled “he” [2]. His idea here is to
            subordinate the participial phrase “running in …” within the
            opening “Having illustrated” phrase, and to create another
            parallel participial phrase, “&amp; continuing …”; both
            phrases will be embedded in the “of which he would run”
            clause. The result would be an “of which he would run
            &amp; point … running … &amp; continuing …”
            structure. But he immediately stops to consider whether he
            might be able to do without the ampersand so that the
            parallel phrases would appear as “running … continuing.” He
            cancels the first ampersand [3], but reconsiders and
            rewrites another ampersand beside it [4], and cancels that
            second one as well [5]. Putting an end to the waffling, he
            restores the ampersand yet again (writing it for a third
            time in a row) and continues writing almost to the end of
            his passage: “&amp; continuing his illustrations by
            seizing the fleshy part of my arm in his teeth &amp;
            intimating that” [6]. Arriving at the word “that,” his
            impulse is to go directly to “that the people who lived,”
            etc., but he stops himself, cancels “that” to add “by the
            whole operation” as a modifier, and continues on with “by
            the whole operation that the people who lived over in that
            direction would like nothing better than to pick” [7]. With
            “pick,” HM has the idea of saying something like “pick at my
            bones,” but he cancels that thought immediately and
            continues on with “treat me in just such a manner” [8].</p>
          <p>In a subsequent series of proofreading phases,
            HM's revision strategy is to transform the overlong
            sentence fragment into a compound sentence. But his first
            revision is to return to the “&amp; continuing” problem
            that he wrestled with in first composing the line. Finding
            that “&amp; continuing” and “&amp; intimating,”
            later in the passage, are repetitious, he cancels yet again
            the third-in-a-row ampersand in “&amp; continuing” so
            that he has “continuing … &amp; intimating” coordinated
            [9]. But the removal of that ampersand effectively destroys
            the greater parallelism of “running … &amp; continuing”
            already established. So for a final time, he reinserts the
            word “and” above his string of three canceled ampersands,
            and he cancels the ampersand in “&amp; intimating.” This
            gives the final structure of “running … and continuing …
            intimating” [10].</p>
          <p>Continuing his proofreading phase, HM confronts the problem
            of what to do with the entire sentence fragment. Returning
            to the beginning of the passage, he first cancels “Having
            illustrated his meaning.” Probably at this point he
            considered a new opening by squeezing “He” at the end of the
            line, intending something like “He thus far explained,” etc.
            [11], but he quickly cancels “He,” and capitalizing “thus”
            by inscribing a <hi rend="italics">T</hi> over the <hi rend="italics">t</hi> in “thus,” he finalizes his sentence
            structure by inserting a sentence-making clause, “he
            explained his meaning,” to render “Thus far, he explained
            his meaning” [12]. This he revises in successive acts to “he
            explained his idea” [12a], and then “he explained himself”
            [12b]. In a final bit of tinkering, HM revises “run” in “he
            would run” to “he would dart” in order to eliminate the
            redundancy of “running” two lines down [13].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM and, perhaps in some instances,
            an editor in preparing the English edition, tinkered with

            “outside the house” to “out of the house” and “toward” to
            “towards” may have been editorial. However, HM probably
            performed the revision of “seemed to imply” to “showed,”
            probably to eliminate the repetition of “imply” later on in

          <p>HM stumbles as he transcribes Kory-Kory's
            Polynesian. Two revision sequences are possible for
            RS11ms140. In the first scenario, HM's first
            impulse is to inscribe “cockoo” (a banana paste) [step A1],
            but he vacilates, canceling it, then repeating it [A2]. He
            then cancels “cockoo” again, inscribes “poe poe” (a mixture
            of breadfruit and water), then reinscribes “nue nue cockoo”
            [A3], and finishes off the dialogue with “— oh nue nue nue
            nue nue!” The second possibility is that HM is not
            vacilating but has confused “cockoo cockoo” with “poe poe”
            or that he considered “cockoo cockoo” to be a typical
            Polynesian intensifier formulation (with the double wording
            meaning something like “a lot of banana paste”), in which
            case he would have initially inscribed “cockoo cockoo” [B1]
            as a single phrase, canceled the phrase, and proceeded
            immediately with “poe poe” and the rest of the line of
            dialogue [B2]. In a later proofreading (RS11ms141), HM
            returns to Kory-Kory's speech to tend to the string
            of five <hi rend="italics">nue</hi>s (each meaning "lots")
            he has inscribed, either intentionally or inadvertently. The
            long series, perhaps originally intended as an excessive
            intensifier of “everything,” seems linguistically unlikely
            even for the excited Kory-Kory, and on second thought, HM
            may have made his “ki ki” insertion [4] to modulate the
            excess. Chances are, however, that HM did not intend the
            excess but had simply failed to inscribe “ki ki” after the
            second “nue” during initial composition. In either case, HM
            returned to this site in a proofreading phase and inserted
            “ki ki Oh” between the second and third “nue” to give “oh
            nue nue ki ki Oh nue nue nue!” [4]. Here, as a noun “ki ki”
            means “things to eat” or even “sacrifice.” Coming after “nue
            nue cockoo,” “nue nue ki ki” is likely to mean “plenty of
            eats.” HM does not, however, provide a translation for the
            “ki ki” phrase in the rest of his sentence, skipping instead
            to “plenty of everything.”</p>

          <p>The second appearance of HM's L-word was inscribed at this site as a late
            insertion. HM first wrote “which rendered into
            Victoria's English would imply” [step 1]. In a
            proofreading phase, he then revised either to
            “Victoria's plain English” [2A] by inserting the
            word “plain,” or to simply “plain English” [2B] by canceling
            “Victoria's” after the insertion of “plain.” Either
            at this same time or at a still later proofreading phase, he
            canceled the phrase, including "rendered into," and inserted
            “liberally interpreted as before” [3]. The phrase “as before” refers to the earlier instance of the L-word (see RS11e181).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="RN11e191" synch="RS11ms142e191" type="narr">
          <p>However, in the first English and first American editions “liberally” appears as “literally” [4 and 5], and yet in the heavily expurgated American Revised edition the L-word is printed as “liberally” [6]. Throughout the nineteenth century, the English and the American Revised editions of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> were distributed equally on their separate sides of the Atlantic; thus, British and American readers read significantly different versions of the novel, one with “literally interpreted,” the other with “liberally interpreted.” Complicating the matter is that in 1892, HM’s literary executor Arthur Stedman prepared a new American edition of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> based on the English edition text, and thereby adopted the “literally” reading [7]. This edition served new generations of readers well into the twentieth century, and probably tipped the scales in favor of “literally” as the word most often read at this particular revision site. However, the now-standard 1968 NN critical edition of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>, which conflates English and American texts, emends the English copy-text to “liberally.” </p>
          
          <p>HM’s L-word is one of literature’s more engaging fluid texts, and it requires further narration on matters involving authorial inscription and intention as well as the cultural transmission of words.</p>
          
          <p>HM’s handwriting is notoriously indecipherable in places, and the L-word is a case in point. The problem with the inscription of this word here and at RS11e181 is that given HM’s general habit of not crossing <hi rend="italics">t</hi>’s in internal <hi rend="italics">te</hi> combinations, his <hi rend="italics">te</hi> combinations look like <hi rend="italics">be</hi>. Consequently, his inscription of “literal(ly)” looks like “liberal(ly).” The NN edition, which appeared before the discovery of the <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> manuscript, speculated that in changing “literally” in the English and first American editions to “liberally” in the American Revised edition, HM was correcting an error.  Their primary argument that HM, and not an editor or printer, ordered the AR change is based on convincing bibliographical evidence.  In order to remove expurgated text and create the Revised American edition, Wiley’s printers broke up and reset certain sections of type in the original first American edition, causing typographical errors in and around the revision sites.  But the L-word does not appear in the vicinity of any such expurgation, and the NN editors reason that the isolated change in the L-word was not such a typo; nor, because of the cost involved, was the change likely to be editorial.  However, editors would have honored an author’s request for such an isolated change, and chances are that HM requested the change.  The subsequent discovery that HM inscribed the word “liberally” and “liberal” in manuscript supports the conclusion that in making the change to <hi rend="italics">liberal</hi> HM was “correcting” his text.  But other revision scenarios need to be considered.</p>
          
          <p>Because the fair copy and English proof sheets of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> have not survived, we cannot determine exactly when or how the L-word change occurred or who made it.  The “cleanest” scenario is that HM inscribed “literal” and “literally” but that he or a relative responsible for creating the fair copy (mis)read it as “liberal” and “liberally,” and this “error” was perpetuated in print, until HM found the error and changed it at the first opportunity he had in the revised edition.  But given the odd interchangeability (yet radical difference) of the two words (discussed below), and given that it would be equally odd that HM would misread his own handwriting—though, of course, this could happen—another scenario is that HM changed his mind about the word and consciously revised it to “literal” and “literally.”  In this “messier” revision scenario, HM would have then changed his mind again, back to the <hi rend="italics">liberal</hi> L-word while arranging for the American Revised edition.  </p>
          
          <p>Occam’s Razor might require us to ignore the messy for the clean scenario, but the nature of the two L-words, especially in the context of HM’s growth during the writing process, indicates that he was occupying a cultural borderland as he wrote that would allow for the “textual oscillation” evident in the L-word.  That is, HM may not have been able to determine, even for himself, whether he (or Tommo) could interpret Polynesian “liberally” or “literally.” Given the context of both manuscript appearances of the L-word, either usage works, even though each word is a virtual antonym of the other.  Moreover, the choice of word makes a significant difference in the way one might read the L-word episode in terms of the colonial encounter and the development of Tommo’s character.</p>
          
          <p>To begin with, the word choice raises the problem of how Tommo treats the Polynesian language and culture, whether he does so with anthropological objectivity (literally) or Western subjectivity and condescension (liberally). For instance, HM’s use of the phrase “as before” in the present site links this translation episode to the same problem in RS11e181 by stressing the continuing process of “interpretation” Tommo must perform. This original comic parallelism and the initial invoking of the Queen’s English might argue for the use of “liberally interpreted” as a derogation. (That is, Polynesian language is so primitive, it requires a loose or liberal treatment in order to be properly converted to the colonizer’s English.) But in dropping the reference to Victoria, HM removes this icon of British colonialism and the intimation of the inferiority of the Polynesian language; and that revision might argue for deciphering the word as the more culturally respectful “literally interpreted.” Interestingly enough, the “interpretation” that HM provides in his translations at both sites wavers between the liberal and literal: it is literal, for example, when he uses the simplest of English denotations to translate “nue nue wai” (see RS11ms141) as “plenty of water”; but liberal when “Happa keekeeno” is rendered as “Terrible fellows those Haapaas” instead of something like the literal “Happaas bad.” The fact that HM shifts back and forth between the literal and liberal makes his textually indeterminate L-word all the more difficult to determine contextually.</p>
          
          <p>In short, HM’s initial intention most certainly was to inscribe “liberal” and “liberally,” and he may have corrected the English and American texts to sustain that intention.  Or he may have changed his mind repeatedly, thus vacillating between “liberal” and “literal.”  Such an oscillating variant suggests ongoing revision rather than correction.  From the perspective of nineteenth-century and more modern readers, the variants seem to oscillate even more, with British texts reading “literal” and American reading “liberal.”  Given the authorial and readerly indeterminacies involved, HM’s L-word remains a bibliographically and culturally iconic fluid text.

            Kory-Kory's harangue: “As he continued his harange
            however, Kori Kori like more polished orators” [2]. But he
            stops at “like more polished orators” to rethink his

            his subject, enlarging perhaps upon the moral reflections
            that it naturally produced,” [3]. Apart from the higher
            diction of “in emulation of” (which lends itself to the
            comic effect), the shift from “more polished orators” to
            “our more polished orators” adds a subtly divisive factor in
            HM's satiric tone. The former expression refers to
            the general class of polished orators, whereas the latter
            specifies that class as “ours,” that is, “of the civilized

            absolute polish to civilization's orators and
            implies the nonexistence of native orators. But either at

            rather diffusely into his subject” to “began to launch out
            rather diffusely into other branches of his subject,” thus
            lending more action and specificity. He also converted
            “perhaps” to “probably.” And returning to the already
            revised “that it naturally gave rise to,” he revised again
            to simply “it suggested.”</p>

          <p>HM's last paragraph in his complex description of
            Kory-Kory's interpreted and yet unintelligible
            “harangue” (a comic afterpiece to Toby's harrowing
            escape) also serves as the conclusion to the entire chapter.
            HM most certainly composed the paragraph as he inscribed it
            and revised heavily in proofreading, but finally it was
            probably the derogatory portrait of Kory-Kory that induced
            HM to cut the passage altogether in his fair-copy stage.
            Interestingly enough, the language-as-fricassee joke removed
            here reappeared in print in HM's next book, <hi rend="italics">Omoo</hi>.</p>
          <p>Essentially, to finish this episode and chapter, HM
            completed the sentence begun in RS11ms146 and composed five
            more sentences of varying length and intensity. Initially HM
            inscribes without interruption: “&amp; proceeding in a
            strain of unintelligible gibberish, in the promotion of
            which he reminded me of a man with his mouthful of chub
            spluttering choking &amp; spitting the bones out in
            every direction. Such a horrific crucifying(?) jargon never
            was heard before” [step 1]. “Chub” is a particularly bony
            fish. The word “crucifying” is a tempting and likely
            speculation; however, the inscribed word looks more like
            “clucifying,” and might be “calcifying.”</p>
          <p>In one or two successive proofreading phases, probably at
            the moment of initial composition and before moving on to
            his next sentence, HM first inserts “surely” with a caret
            after “never” to give “never surely was heard” [2], but then
            he cancels the caret and repositions the insertion by
            placing a new caret in front of “never,” to give “surely
            never was heard” [3]. Perhaps at the same time or in a
            separate proofreading phase, but one that follows his
            repositioning of “surely,” HM places a caret in front of
            “jargon” and inserts “merciless” above that word and halfway
            into the left-hand margin to give “merciless jargon” [4].
            (The timing of “merciless” has to do with its placement
            significantly to the left of “surely,” as if HM wanted to
            give each insertion room. Also, a later insertion [see
            RS11ms151] running vertically up the margin crosses over
            “merciless,” obscuring the letters <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, thus indicating that the insertion of “merciless”
            occurred before HM moved on to the rest of his paragraph.)</p>
          <p>Next, HM continued on with the invention of his image of
            language as a “fricassee of vowels and consonants,” but he
            is not satisfied with it. Initially he writes, “All these
            mad sounds seemed to be served up in a hasty fricassee” [5],
            which he hastily revises to “hasty kind of fricassee” [6],
            but he then cancels the entire sentence, starting over with
            a new introductory gambit which removes the suggestion of
            madness: “It seemed to be a fricassee of vowels and
            consonants dashed with a spice of cayenne” [7]. At this
            point or in a later proofreading phase, he altered the
            opening and removed “dashed with a spice of cayenne” to give
            “It was nothing more than a fricassee of vowels and
            consonants” [8]. He then attempts to complete his paragraph
            but stops short at the word “with.” This he immediately
            revises to “from,” and then finishes his paragraph: “Heaven
            defend me from such another infliction! It gave me rheumatic
            pains in every joint in my body — What it all meant I could
            not life of me conjecture without he was imploying (?) the
            occasion to enlarge upon the transitory nature of all human
            enjoyments &amp; the vanity of terrestrial expectations.
            ——” [9]. In his haste HM inscribes “for life of me” instead
            of “for the life of me,” a slip he probably corrected later
            on.</p>
          <p>In a series of proofreading phases, HM returned to this
            passage, probably as soon as he completes the paragraph. The
            exact sequence of these revisions is not certain. The
            largest occurs at the site of the “fricassee” image.
            Canceling “It” and turning the MS page sideways, he wrote,
            up the left margin, a new version of his opening: “It might
            have been denominated a &amp;c &amp;c” to give the
            final reading of “It might have been denominated a a
            fricassee of vowels and consonants” [10]. HM then drew a
            line to connect the insertion to the appropriate caret mark
            in the original sentence; he does not, however, notice the
            inadvertent repetition of the indefinite article “a.” In
            all, the initial elimination of “mad sounds” in this passage
            may be taken as a toning down of a description that had
            become too much of a burlesque of Polynesian behavior.</p>
          <p>HM continued to tinker with the passage. Probably in
            coordination with the revision of “produced” at RS11ms148,
            HM altered his original “in the promotion of which” to “in
            the course of which” [11], which eliminates the alliteration
            with “produced.” He also corrected the “not life of me”
            problem by inserting “for the” [12]. Finally, he revised
            “he” in “without he was imploying” to “without the speaker
            was imploying” [13].</p>

          <p>As interesting as this lengthy burlesque of Kory-Kory might
            have been, HM thought better of it. And in coordination with
            other tonings down of the satire, he simply deleted the
            entire passage in his fair-copy stage, reducing his final
            line to an expansion of the half-sentence that opens this
            revision site. The final wording in the English edition is
            “and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and
            stunning gibberish that he actually gave me the headache for
            the rest of the day” [14]. HM's engaging image of
            language as a “fricassee” was not entirely lost, however,
            for it reappeared in his next book as part of the
            description of Varvy and Long Ghost's late night,
            boozy, English-Polynesian conversation: “they made such a
            fricassee of vowels and consonants, that it was enough to

          <p>In revising the opening paragraph of this chapter during
            his fair-copy stage, HM made largely routine, mostly
            single-word revisions. In his opening sentence [step 1], he
            dropped “almost completly” and converted “natives” to the
            more graphic “warriors” [2], avoiding other previously used,
            more pejorative choices, such as “enemies” and
          “savages.”</p>

            Tinor” in print chapter 11 and “old Tinor” in chapter 13.
            Here, in MS chapter 12, print chapter 14, HM returns to the
            epithet “affectionate” but in the fair-copy stage revised
            “affectionate” to “good.” Subsequent iterations of “Tinor”
            leave off an epithet altogether, as if the character of the
            affectionate, good, old lady were at this point clearly
            enough established.</p>

          <p>HM may be copying at this point from earlier notes or
            drafts. The false start “co” [step 1] may be nothing more
            than an aborted, inadvertent repetition of the earlier word
            “complaint.” However, if HM is revising as he copies, or
            composing fresh material, the letters might be a false start
            on “completely,” as in “origin completely mysterious to both
            of us.” In any event, HM stops himself in mid-word, cancels
            “co” and continues to the end of his sentence with
            “&amp; character of which were matters of complete
            mystery to both of us” [2]. In a proofreading phase, he
            revised “character” to “nature” [3].</p>

          <p>HM's sentence was further altered in two ways.
            Either he or an editor converted “beneath” to the more
            accurate “under” [4]. Tinkering with the final phrase of the
            sentence during his fair-copy stage (perhaps in coordination
            with the removal of “almost completly” in RS12e1), he
            revised “matters of complete mystery” to “still a mystery,”
            and dropped “to both of us.”</p>

        <div id="RN12e6-8" synch="RS12e6-8" type="narr">
          <p>In the final MS version, HM's sentence begins with
            a long series of participial phrases (“Despairing … cut …
            &amp; feeling; Knowing too … &amp; apprehending …”)
            [step 1]. However, the English text is significantly reduced.  One scenario is that, recognizing his series was overloaded, HM revised in his fair-copy stage by first deleting his initial phrase “Despairing of obtaining any effectual remedy for it” and then beginning his new sentence with “Cut off” [2].  In effect, the deletion eliminates the aural and, possibly, intellectual redundancy of “effectual remedy” and “inefficacy of any thing.” In separate
            revisions also in the fair-copy stage, he would have altered
            “inefficacy” to “inefficiency” and “do for me” to “do to
            relieve me.” HM's initial use of “effectual remedy”
            and “inefficacy of any thing” is somewhat askew in the usage
            of the day when “effectual” referred to the power to perform
            actions and “efficacy” had a special association with
            medicinal remedy. Thus, the sentence might have been more
            grammatical had HM written something like “efficacious
            remedy” and the cumbersome “ineffectuality of any thing.”
            HM's final remedy was to drop “effectual” along
            with his opening participial phrase and revise “inefficacy”
            to the more appropriate “inefficiency,” which in the usage
            of his day (according to Fowler) applies to agents or their
            actions. The word appears as “inefficacy” in A and AR [3]. As with the oscillation between “luxurious” and “luxuriant” in Revision Site 10ms31e25, a remote possibility is that Gansevoort made the change from “inefficiency” to “inefficacy” here during his cursory proofreading of the English proofs of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> that he had received and dashed off on the same day to be re-set in New York.

          <p>Initially HM writes without interruption “it would be
            impossible for me to leave the valley, never mind what the
            oportunity presented” [step 1]. However, in the pencil
            substage, he or his brother Gansevoort penciled a dot at the
            end of this line to indicate the need for some kind of
            revision of the colloquial expression “never mind” [2].
            Later HM performed the change by canceling “never mind” and
            inserting “no matter” over it [3]. The change seems to be
            just minor tinkering; however, “never mind” is an imperative
            that implicitly invites readers to join in Tommo's
            thinking, and since Tommo is becoming more self-involved in
            his isolation at this point, the shift to “no matter”
            removes the small hint of audience participation and
            enhances Tommo's growing self-absorption.</p>

          <p>Initially HM does not interrupt his initial inscription of
            the conclusion of his lengthy series of participial phrases
            [step 1]. In a proofreading phase, he made two important
            revisions designed to heighten tensions and deepen
            Tommo's sense of alienation. Probably his first
            revision was to insert “abandoned all thoughts for succes
            &amp;” to render “… I now abandoned all thoughts for
            succes &amp; became a prey …” [2]. Either at this point
            or some time later, he altered “for succes” to “of succes”
            by inscribing “of” over “for” [3]; he did not, however,
            correct the spelling of “succes.” In a second revision, he
            canceled “the natives” (but not the preposition “of”
            preceding it). Giving himself ample room in the left margin
            so as to avoid running up against the insertion of step 2
            occupying the space to the right, he also inserted “on the
            part of the savages,” thus rendering “…some sudden caprice
            of on the part of the savages” [4]. (For revisions to
            “savage,” see also RS12ms104, ms111, e207, and ms151; for
            revisions involving “native” and “islander,” see also

          <p>In his fair-copy stage [5], HM performed five separate
            revisions mostly designed in some way to tone down the
            stressful tensions he had inserted in MS. The alteration of
            “apprehending” to “apprehensive” in fact increases tension;
            however, the revision of “fall victims” to “be exposed,” the
            dropping of “sudden” from “sudden caprice,” and the
            modulation of “savages” to “islanders” all serve to lessen
            tension. (The correction of “of on the part” to “on the
            part” was probably made in fair copy.) A fifth set of
            revisions brought the conversion of “I now abandoned all
            thoughts of succes &amp; became a prey to the most
            gloomy imaginings” to “I now gave up all hopes of recovery,
            and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts.” Quite
            possibly, in tinkering with the clause, HM came upon the
            Dantean phrasing “I now abandoned all hopes of success,”
            thus converting his island paradise into a kind of personal
            inferno. But either he or an editor felt the allusion (if in
            fact he considered the phrasing) would be forced or
            inappropriate in some way. Thus, “abandoned” gave way to
            “gave up” and “all hopes of success” became “all hopes of
            recovery.” At the same time, “gloomy imaginings” is toned
            down by transferring the abandoned “thoughts” to the end of
            the sentence to give “gloomy thoughts.”</p>

          <p>HM originally inscribes “A Deep dejection fell upon me,
            which neither the friendly remonstrances of my companion”
            [step 1], and cancels “my” either at the moment of
            composition or directly after composing “companion,” with
            the idea, perhaps, of creating a series of generalized
            prepositional phrases: something like “the remonstrances of
            companion, the devotions of servitor, etc.” But when he
            reaches “devotions” [2], he immediately modulates this
            approach, opting for a more specific expression, “devoted
            attentions of Kori Kori,” which he achieves by writing “ed”
            over the “ions” in “devotions.” With this expression
            completed, he continued on to the end of his sentence with
            “nor all the soothing influences of Faaua could in any wise
            dissapate or assuage” [3] However, in continuing on, HM does

            and 24). The six changes to the opening clause [step 1] are
            routine, single-word alterations designed to tighten the
            prose [2]. Here, “I reclined” becomes “I lay” and “one of
            those melancholy reveries” is shortened to simply
            “melancholy reverie.” HM also compressed “what was going on
            around me” to “everything around me” and “left my side” to
            “left me.” In addition, he cut “previous” from “an hour
            previous” and “great” from “great haste.” It is unlikely
            that Murray's editor would have made such changes;
            however, Gansevoort, who proofed HM's page proofs,

          <p>Uncharacteristically, HM has begun the second paragraph of
            chapter 12 on a line of its own, leaving blank space at the
            end of the preceding paragraph (the chapter's
            opening paragraph). The implication is that HM had paused in
            his writing at the end of the opening paragraph, perhaps
            retired for a moment or the day, and returned some time
            later to start up writing again with the second paragraph.
            If HM had been in the heat of fresh composition, it would
            have been odd for him to have stopped so soon after
            beginning a new chapter. Perhaps he was simply exhausted;
            perhaps the interruption was the result of nothing more than
            someone knocking at his door. If, however, he had been
            simply copying, this point in the text would have been as
            good as any other for taking a rest. In any event, HM
            initially inscribes this paragraph with only one apparent
            false start. Reaching the point in his sentence in which
            Toby comes to him with the good news of the arrival of
            boats, he writes: “&amp; with a flush of delight upon
              his<hi rend="italics"> dark</hi>” [step A1]. Canceling
            “dark” as soon as he writes it, he then continues on with
            “countenance told me to cheer up” [A2]. A second and quite
            likely scenario is that “dark” is not a false start but that
            HM composed the entire line [B1] and canceled “dark” later
            in a proofreading phase [B2]. Whatever the timing, the
            removal of “dark” de-emphasizes Toby's already
            established dark complexion. Perhaps HM felt that the word
            clashed with “flush of delight” or that it hinted at some
            undesired racial or emotional association.</p>

            the phrase may have been removed because the bustling

            “This news” [2]. Chances are, in retrospect, HM wanted to
            reserve the word “intelligence” for its specialized meaning
            of a communication through the “vocal telegraph” of the

            revised to the less standard “which pervaded” [2]. His

            However, a second possibility is that HM may be editing as
            he copies or composes, cutting words as he writes them
            knowing they will be put to different use later in the
            sentence. If so, he would have inscribed “&amp; loud”

            which the sound of the “vocal telegraph” is compared to
            rising and falling of a “musician's gamut,” or
            scale of notes. But HM removed this paragraph, and chances

          <p>The revision of “sounds” [step 1] for “intelligence” [2]
            may be coordinated with the cancellation of “intelligence”
            in the previous sentence (see RS12ms8). In effect, HM is
            presenting a deeper view into the natives'
            communications practice: the “sounds” of the vocal telegraph
            are not just noise; they carry meaning, vital news,
            strategic information, or “intelligence,” and the islanders
            are conscious (even apprehensive) of how this information
            bears upon their livelihood and defenses. Interestingly
            enough, the MS shift earlier at RS12ms8e25 from
            “intelligence” to “news” and then finally to “tidings” in
            print adds more to our understanding of the specialized
            genealogy of the word “intelligence” in HM's use of
            it: Tommo's initial use of the word means little
            more than information about an occurrence of importance to
            him, but the “news” for him is not like the news the natives
            receive, which has the strategic bearing of “intelligence.”
            The revision strategy seems to be to invest more political
            and intellectual engagement in the natives than in the
            self-involved Tommo.</p>

            cross-hatching rather than the more typical straight

            more likely scenario is that HM composed his sentence [step

            Stopping at “from the sea to,” he considers adding a time
            element, cancels the phrase in two strokes, and continues on
            with “in a very few minutes from the sea to the very head of
            the valley” [2]. However, “the very head of the valley”
            repeats “very” in “in a very few minutes,” so to eliminate

          <p>Having introduced the vocal telegraph, HM sets out in this
            moderately revised, but eventually discarded, paragraph to
            describe its aural effect. HM's image of natives
            yelling their message up from the shore, past him, and into
            the mountains, with increasing and decreasing volume, is
            both complex and musically sophisticated; it is perhaps the
            earliest indication (and one of the few) of HM's
            acquaintance with music. Initially HM composes the paragraph
            with only one false start in which he inscribes “wh,”
            intending to write the word “were” [step 1]. Canceling this,
            he then completes his sentence [2]. (The word “??zans”
            remains undeciphered; it appears canceled but is, in fact,
            obscured by ink that has soaked through from the obverse
            page.) In a proofreading phase (or perhaps several), HM
            tinkered with the passage, mostly to clarify the aural
            effect he wanted to convey, but also to tighten sentence
            structure. Initially that structure barely hangs together
            with a somewhat repetitive use of ampersands: “The sounds
            advancing … &amp; swelling higher &amp; higher …,
            &amp; then sinking away …, suggested …” By inserting “at
            first scarcely audible &amp;” after “The sounds” and by
            canceling the ampersand in “&amp; swelling” [3], he
            retained the same number of ampersands, but achieved a more
            dynamic rhythm: “The sounds at first scarcely audible
            &amp; advancing … swelling higher &amp; higher …
            &amp; then sinking away …, suggested…,” which in effect
            gives the sentence both a sense of urgency and musical flow.
            In another proofreading revision, HM no doubt noticed the
            repetition of “until they reached” and “untill they became
            lost,” and substituted “as” for the first “until” [4]. At
            some point, he also revised “reached” to “approached” [5]
            The shift has lexical and aural implications. On the one
            hand, “to reach” can mean either arrive at or approach;
            whereas “to approach” leaves no doubt that the maximum has
            not been fully achieved. Thus, HM is making a fine, somewhat
            Platonic, distinction. On the other hand, sound itself may
            be playing the major role in the revision, for “approached”
            creates an assonance with “as,” thus supplying the evolving
            sentence with an aural as well as logical coherency. Of
            course, the exact sequence of changes cannot be determined
            with certainty. HM may have considered the shift from
            “reached” to “approached” before the revision of “until” to
            “as,” thus playing first with “until they approached” and
            then later on changing to “as they approached.” In yet
            another proofreading insertion, HM added a crucial
            descriptive moment in the overall aural imagery. Initially
            he had simply written that after the sounds “reached their
            maximum” in volume, they were then heard “sinking away.”
            However, this is not the fullest verbal realization of the
            aural phenomenon from Tommo's mid-valley point of
            view (or rather point of hearing). HM therefore inserted
            “sweeping by &amp;” before the word “sinking” to give
            “sweeping by &amp; sinking away” [6]. But either as he
            made the insertion or at a still later proofreading phase,
            he altered “by &amp;” to “still on &amp;” thus
            revising to “sweeping still on &amp; sinking away” [7].
            As with the change to “as they approached,” the revision
            adds aural coherency, this time with the more pronounced
            sibilance of “sweeping, still, sinking.” Finally, HM
            returned to the first word of the passage and converted “The
            sounds” to the miswritten “Theses sounds” by attaching “ses”
            to “The” [7]. The placing of this revision late in the
            process is based on the cramped nature of the revision due
            to the already existing insertion of step 3. HM did not
            correct “Theses” to “These” in MS.</p>

          <p>HM seems to be creating new material at this point. His
            goal is to convey the activities of the various natives in a
            long compound sentence, and initially he begins to write
            “Some were stripping coconuts” [step 1]. But as he writes,
            he immediately alters “stripping coconuts” to “tearing the
            husks off of coconuts” and finishes the sentence with “—
            others perched in the trees,” etc. [2]. In a later
            proofreading phase, HM played with the parallel structure of
            the entire sentence. Initially, he had established a “Some
            were tearing … others perched in the trees were throwing …
            while some were plying …” structure. To tighten this
            listless series, he first revised “while some were plying”
            to “while others still were plying,” thus giving a “some …
            others … others still” parallelism. He then decided to cut
            out the coconuts by canceling “Some were tearing the husks
            off of coconuts — others,” and inserting “many of them” [4],
            thus radically altering his sentence structure to “Many of

            were plying.” Why the elimination of coconuts? Either
            HM's memory is serving him better at this point,
            and recalling that on this occasion only breadfruit was
            collected, he cuts the reference accordingly; or he senses
            the reader might be confused a bit because in the initial
            formulation the use of “the trees” implies “coconut trees”
            even though HM's natives are perched in breadfruit
            trees.</p>

            them perched” in the following clause to “some perched” and
            dropped “still” from “while others still,” thus creating a
            finalized structure of “Some were tearing…; some perched…;
            while others were plying” [RN12e34 and 36]. In addition, he
            changed the colloquial “plying their fingers like lightning

            not been recovered. Evidently, HM is revising as he writes.
            His first impulse is to continue with details concerning the
            natives bustling down to barter at the shore, and he writes
            “Here you would see” [step 1]—which is, in fact, the
            beginning of the second sentence of what would become the
            print version of his paragraph—but HM cancels the clause
            immediately to add a more generalized opening line “There
            were other {matters, etc.}” [2].</p>

          <p>Initially HM writes “This conduct on” [step 1], intending
            something like “This conduct on their part,” but interrupts
            himself mid-thought. Canceling “conduct on” with a single
            pen stroke, he continues to write “singular conduct of
            these,” rendering “This singular conduct of these” [2],
            intending something like “This singular conduct of these
            natives.” He then pauses and cancels “of these” with a
            single stroke, replacing it on the baseline with “on their
            part,” and finishes off the sentence with “not a little
            puzzeled me at the time, but subsequent events &amp; a
            further knowledge of their character eventually explained
            it” [3]. In a proofreading phase, he canceled “but
            subsequent events” in two strokes to give, temporarily,
            “&amp; a further knowledge of their character explained
            it” [4]. To make two sentences out of his compound, he
            canceled the ampersand in “&amp; a further knowledge” to
            render “a further knowledge” [5]. And HM probably let his
            two sentences stand in this form for some time. In a later
            proofreading phase, after he had completed this chapter, he
            returned to this site to rectify a contradiction that had
            brewed in his evolving text. Here, as it stands, HM has
            Tommo say that “events and further knowledge” explain the
            natives' happy acceptance of Toby's
            request to accompany them to the shore. And presumably, HM
            had initially planned to reveal those events and knowledge.
            But later in the chapter, in an English edition subsection
            entitled “mysterious conduct of the islanders,” Tommo finds
            the natives' reticence to tell what happened to
            Toby on the beach to be “inexplicable.” Returning to
            proofread at this revision site, HM found that his second
            clause promising “further knowledge” and an explanation had
            to be revised to emphasize the “air of mystery” to come. To
            do this, he canceled the entire second clause (“a further
            knowledge of their character eventually explained it”),
            depleting the ink in his quill at the word “eventualy” and
            replenishing the quill to cancel “explained it” in two heavy
            strokes. He then inserted above the cancellation a
            replacement phrase: “&amp; imparted to subsequent events
            an additional air of mystery” [6]. Probably in this same
            proofreading phase, he returned to his first clause and
            momentarily considered revising to something like “Their
            singular conduct not a little puzzled me,” and he began the
            process by canceling “This” and “singular conduct” with
            separate pen strokes [7]. However, he interrupted himself in
            mid-cancellation and effectively restored these three words
            by putting crosshatch marks over the already canceled words
            “conduct on” and “of these,” which are interspersed among
            the three words, “This singular conduct” [8], that he wished
            to restore. Probably at this time, he also added
            cross-hatching over his newly canceled second clause.</p>

            “This singular conduct on their part” to “Their singular
            conduct on this occasion” [RN12e38-39]. And he revised “an

            [2], perhaps simply to prevent a repetition of “natives” in
            the previous paragraph. In addition, HM's insertion
            of “to be seen” [3] shifts the narrative slightly from the

          <p>HM's initial thought is to remind the reader of
            Toby's lost hat and begin with something like
            “&amp; giving him my hat — for it will be recalled that
            he had lost his own.” Instead, he stops himself mid-thought
            with the words “for it will be” [step 1], cancels “it will
            be,” opts for “he had lost his own as has been before
            related” [2], and continues with the rest of his sentence.
            In a proofreading phase, HM inserted more information to
            remind readers of Toby's head wound (suffered
            during his first attempt to leave): he canceled “my hat,”
            but in writing “payta hat to shield his wounded head from
            the sun” he inadvertently left out “my” [3]. Some time
            later, during the pencil substage, he or Gansevoort placed a
            penciled dot in the right margin of this sentence and
            another mark next to “payta” to indicate the need for the
            further insertion of “my” [4]. Later on and with ink, HM
            placed a caret before the already canceled “my hat” and
            inserted “my” to the left of the previously inserted and
            pencil-marked “payta hat” phrase. Probably at the same time,
            he considered inserting “hat” farther down the sentence
            after “own” (to give “his own hat”), but inscribing only
            “ha” of the intended insertion “hat” [5], he realized that
            the pronoun would suffice and canceled the false start
            immediately [6].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM made relatively small
            alterations, but the result was a significant revision of
            the rhythm of his paragraph. Initially, he had composed a
            single-sentence paragraph consisting of five coordinated
            clauses joined by four ampersands used as coordinating
            conjunctions. Here, he revised to three sentences with only
            three <hi rend="italics">and</hi>s serving to create
            compound predicates. The overall effect is less repetition
            and smoother pace. In two of the three revisions featured
            here [7], he contributed to this effect first by converting
            “giving him my payta hat” to “gave him my payta hat” and
            then repunctuating “he cordially returned …” into a new
            sentence, and second by trimming “for he had lost his own as
            has been before related” to the tighter “as he had lost his
            own.” In addition, he made an incidental lexical revision of
            “my grasp” to “my hand.”</p>

          <p>Initially HM inscribes the rest of his paragraph, and
            indeed the rest of this MS leaf, without much hesitation.
            However, he comes to a false start on the word “should” by
            writing “as soon as the boats as” [step 1]. No doubt the
            repetition of “as” in “as soon as” compelled his hand to
            miswrite a third “as.” Canceling the false start, he
            inscribes “should” and completes his sentence [2]. In a
            proofreading phase, HM repositioned the misplaced adverb
            “solemnly” to put the emphasis on “promise” rather than
            “return” [3]. Probably in a different proofreading phase,
            and perhaps intending to eliminate the repetition of “path”
            in his opening sentence, he tinkered with this last word in
            his last sentence. He first canceled “path” and inserted
            “wood” to give “turn of the wood” [4], which gives the odd,
            unintended impression of a lathe at work. Chances are he
            canceled that alternative immediately and substituted
            “grove” [5].</p>

            compound construction (“he cordially returned … he sprang”)
            to a compound verbal (“he cordially returned … sprang”). In
            addition, he made several lexical alterations: he dropped
            “me” from “promising me” [RN12e46], added “the shore” to
            give “should leave the shore” [RN12e47], and converted
            “moment” to “minute” [RN12e49], perhaps to remove a

            eliminate the redundancy in “spies … spying,” he continues
            on with the rest of his sentence [2]. Initially HM has
            confused Aaron for his brother Moses, who sent spies into
            Canaan to bring back evidence of the land of “milk and
            honey” (Numbers 13:3–24), and in a proofreading phase he

            paradise or a promised land, and the reason for the
            expulsion of this clause is not entirely clear. Perhaps the
            implied comparison between the Biblical grapes and the

            ludicrous or somehow blasphemous. Perhaps, too, the phrasing

            to “and appeared solely intent upon reaching” [2]. The
            change in tone here gives slightly less attention to
            Tommo's point of view. And he revised “careless
            whether his cocoa nuts kept company with him or not” [1] to
            the more sensible “careless how many of his cocoa-nuts kept
            company with him” [2]. The effect here is to make the comic
            moment less cartoonish: The native seeking barter would
            obviously “care” if he lost all his coconuts.</p>

          <p>Initially HM composes his sentence without any revision
            [step 1]. However, at some time (either in proofreading or
            even much later after the publication of the novel, as
            speculated below), the name “Faaua” is altered to “Fayaway”
            [2]. HM or someone else made the change by inserting a <hi rend="italics">y</hi> between the first two <hi rend="italics">a</hi>s (with an overmarking of the <hi rend="italics">au</hi> combination to create a <hi rend="italics">w</hi>), and then adding another <hi rend="italics">y</hi> at the end. This revision appears to
            be evidence of HM's having begun to anglicize his
            Polynesian names at an early stage of composition; however,
            the fact that this is the only instance of such a revision
            in the extant MS makes this conclusion highly problematic.
            This is the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> occurrence of an
            anglicized and romanticized spelling of a Polynesian
            character name in the MS; HM retains his initial spellings
            of Faaua, and all other Polynesian names, everywhere else in
            the MS. The only other evidence of any kind of orthographic
            experimentation of this kind is the tinkering with “Marheyo”
            found on the MS cover folder, which HM performed probably
            well after having moved on from his working draft MS to
            other stages of development. It seems odd then that HM would
            have adjusted the spelling of Faaua at this one site only
            but not elsewhere, and adjusted only the spelling of Faaua
            and not Kori-Kori, Maheyo, or Tipi and his various spellings
            of Nuku Hiva. Of course, it is possible that one of
            HM's last acts before completing the MS and moving
            on to his fair-copy stage was to make this one change in
            spelling as the initiation of a series of Polynesian
            spelling changes which he would complete in later stages.
            Another possibility is that HM adjusted this one MS spelling
            well after he published <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>. This
            startling conjecture is based on the unknown provenance of
            leaf 13 (on which the altered “Faaua” appears). Up until the
            1983 discovery of the <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>
            fragment, leaf 13 was the only known piece of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> MS. It is not known how or why
            it became separated from the other leaves, but it is worth
            speculating that HM or a family member parceled it out as a
            souvenir to someone else sometime after <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> had achieved notoriety. If so, it is also
            possible that HM changed the spelling at the time of this
            gift-giving in order to bring the MS spelling of the name of
            his most famous character in line with its more familiar
            version.</p>

            (morbidity) Tommo initially exhibits regarding

            HM revised “It seemed to my sensitive feelings” to “It
            appeared to me” [3], thus further eliminating any admission
            of “morbidity” or “sensitivity” toward Toby. In addition,
            the phrase “at the time” is set off with two grammatically
            unnecessary commas, the effect of which is to give visual
            emphasis to the phrase. Tommo's point, it seems, is
            to remind readers (and perhaps himself) that his feelings of
            the moment regarding Toby are now feelings of the past. By
            reminding us of this narratorial matter, HM announces the
            distance between his feelings now and his feelings then, and
            presumably indicates his growth. Originally, in MS, HM had
            supplied only the second of the two commas; however, it is
            not clear whether he or an editor supplied the first in the
            series (which makes the emphasis discussed here

            the later fair-copy stages. HM did not revise this opening
            sentence [step 1] until the fair-copy stage. Here, he
            removed “&amp; amiable” from “gentle &amp; amiable
            being” [2] probably to eliminate the redundancy in “In this
            amiable light” which opens the paragraph concluding the
            description of Fayaway. He also revised “my notice” to “my
            regard,” which adds complexity to the degree of attention
            Tommo gives Fayaway. Not only does the indifference of
            “notice” give way to the esteem implied in “regard,” but
            also the word's root in the French <hi rend="italics">regarder</hi> (to look) suggests a
            voyeurism on Tommo's part. And the use of “regard”
            in this sense can be seen in coordination with revisions of
            Fayaway's looking at Tommo in which her mere
            “expression” of pity for Tommo becomes first a “glance” and
            then a much deeper “gazing” (see RS12ms68, 69, and 72). In
            short, Tommo's revised “regard” is a form of
            looking that more closely matches the looks he feels he is
            getting from Fayaway. Finally at this site, HM revised “the

            HM stops himself in mid-thought to modify his opener and
            clarify “the rest”; canceling the false start, he writes “Of

            native status thus making her “intelligence and humanity,”

            readers. HM continues with his sentence but makes a second
            false start: “she alone had appeared to appreciate the

            Fayaway's affection for Tommo only in RS12ms72, HM
            altered the time frame to a narrative present, and since
            Toby is no longer present, the reference to past communal
            ministrations is converted to Fayaway's focus on
            Tommo alone, and the pronoun including Toby (“us”) is
            converted to “me.” (For similar alterations to a subsequent
            site made earlier in MS, see RS12ms74.)</p>

          <p>Initially, and without interruption, HM writes “There was a
            tenderness &amp; sympathy in the tones of her sweet
            voice, and an expression of pity in her face which it was
            impossible to misunderstand or resist” and continues on with
            a second sentence: “It plainly assured me…” [step 1].
            Eventually this would become the site of massive revisions
            with two significant effects: first, the revisions shift the
            narrative focus from the recent past in which Fayaway
            ministers to both Tommo and Toby to a narrative present
            focusing on Fayaway's sympathy for Tommo only, and
            second, they dramatize (rather than simply describe)
            Fayaway's affection. The process of revision
            involved at least four stages: some immediate proofreading
            revisions, then a large insertion inscribed on a now-lost
            insertion slip, then later revisions to the original
            sentences in MS to make the large insertion fit into the
            text, and finally further tinkerings in the fair-copy stage.</p>
          <p>In the first proofreading phase, HM revised “an expression
            of pity” to “a glance of pity” [2]. Eventually, “glance”
            would become “gazing” in the larger insertion slip revision,
            and it may be that this particular conversion of
            “expression” to the looking word “glance” was a trigger for
            the larger revision to come. Probably during this same
            proofreading phase, HM also inserted “either” after
            “impossible” [3] for emphasis. Either immediately or at some
            later point upon returning to his text, HM got the idea of
            expanding on Fayaway by letting her act out the “sympathy”
            and “pity” Tommo describes. Chances are this process began
            as HM revised his existing sentence concerning
            Fayaway's “tenderness &amp; sympathy,” either
            simply to tighten the sentence or in fact to prepare the
            sentence for the larger insertion already conceived or
            composed. To do this, he canceled “&amp; sympathy in the
            tones of her sweet voice, and a glance of pity in her face”
            in three confident pen strokes and inserted the words “in
            her manner” to give “tenderness in her manner” [4]. Probably
            at the same time, he squeezed the word “sweet” just above
            the inserted “in her manner” to give “in her sweet manner”
            [5] and thereby include a remnant of the canceled “sweet
            voice.” HM then built on the idea of dramatizing
            Fayaway's “sweet manner”; he composed on a separate
            sheet or sheets, now lost, several lines involving her
            “liveliest sympathy,” “gesture of pity,” “glistening eyes
            gazing,” and plaintive “murmur,” all for Tommo's
            benefit, not Toby's. Once he was satisfied with the
            dramatic expansion, HM attached the separate sheet or sheets
            containing this text to the top of this MS leaf with a
            straight pin, and drew a small circular insertion device
            between the words “resist” and “It” to indicate the
            placement of his insertion [6]. The exact text of this lost
            insertion slip material cannot be known, but it corresponds
            to lines 108.7-12 in the NN <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi>
            [7]. Probably at the time that the new material was secured
            to the main leaf, HM set about revising his existing main
            leaf text to accommodate his insertion slip text. His focus
            was primarily on the word “It” beginning his original second
            sentence. The “It” (although singular) probably refers to
            HM's initial idea of “tenderness &amp;
            sympathy” since the “There was a tenderness &amp;
            sympathy” (rather than “there were”) indicates that HM
            considered this plurality of attributes to be singular, thus
            making “it” grammatically workable. In any event, the
            earlier revision to the clearly singular “There was a
            tenderness in her sweet manner” brought that antecedent into
            unambiguous agreement with the pronoun “It.” But the longer
            “insertion slip” material of step 7 made “It” inappropriate.
            HM, therefore, canceled the pronoun, placed a sweeping caret
            after it, and squeezed “These tokens of her kindly heart” to
            the left and below the circular insertion device used to
            locate the placement of the insertion he had previously
            straight-pinned to the top of his MS leaf [8].</p>

          <p>Further revisions to this site are evident in the English
            edition [9]. In his fair-copy stage, HM removed “sweet” from
            “sweet manner” and “either” from “either to misunderstand or
            resist.” He also revised “These tokens of her kindly heart
            plainly assured me” to “Her manner convinced me.” These
            minor changes calm down the prose a bit, even to the point
            of creating an uncharacteristic repetition of “her manner”
            in the opening and closing sentences. Quite possibly,
            HM's brother, who corrected galleys of this
            chapter, assisted in these changes.</p>

        <div id="RN12ms73-76e93-97" synch="RS12ms73-76e93-97" type="narr">
          <p>Before making the large “insertion slip” insertion (see
            RS12ms72), HM had continued on directly out of the preceding
            sentence (“there was a tenderness &amp; sympathy…”) with
            a follow-up on the effect of Fayaway's kindness.
            Unlike the preceding sentence, which HM first inscribed with
            little hesitation, suggesting that he may have been copying
            from earlier drafts or drawing upon well-rehearsed ideas, HM
            composes this sentence with three false starts. He begins
            “It plainly assured me that shee” [step 1] and stops to
            correct the mis-written “shee.” Canceling the second <hi rend="italics">e</hi> in “shee” [2] he continued on to the
            second false start, “she deeply compassionated our dif.”
            Initially, HM has something in mind like “our difficulty” or
            “our difficult situation” but interrupts that thought in
            mid-word; he cancels “dif” and revises immediately to
            “situation” [3]. Continuing on with “our situation, as being
            far removed from our countrymen &amp; &amp;,” he
            inadvertently inscribes two ampersands, the second of which
            he immediately cancels and then finishes his sentence [4].
            Chances are, HM let his sentence rest at this point, and
            made no further alterations until after the insertion slip
            revisions of RS12ms72. After making this insertion, he
            revised the opening of this sentence from “It plainly
            assured me” to “These tokens of her kindly heart plainly
            assured me” [step 5; see also RN12ms71]. Probably at this
            point, HM recognized the need to alter his pronoun “our”
            (which includes the now-absent Toby as the object of
            Fayaway's consolations) to “my” [6], thus giving
            exclusive attention to Tommo. Both instances of “our” appear
            at the end of consecutive lines, one directly above the
            other, and HM probably revised both at the same time by
            canceling each and supplying, without carets, a “my” in the
            right margin for each cancellation. This minor change
            reflects a major narrative shift in this scene from a moment
            in the past when Fayaway tended to both sailors to a
            narrative present in which Fayaway tends to Tommo alone.
            Interestingly enough, HM was not thorough in implementing
            this strategy: further down the sentence, he retains “bound
            us to our homes,” as well as “our return” and “behold
          us.”</p>

            prose-tightening revisions to this sentence in his fair-copy
            stage [7]. He deleted “far” from “far removed,” converted
            “countrymen” to “country,” dropped “seemingly” from
            “seemingly placed,” and compressed “all hope of succer or

            [2], but the compression decidedly discounts
            Fayaway's female intellect by removing

            given a deeper and subtler balance of head and heart,

            notion of Fayaway's superior intelligence might
            strain Western credulity. Whatever the reason,

            companion appeared not” [step 1]. But in a proofreading
            phase, he sharpened the sense of the conflict between
            Tommo's hopes and the reality of Toby's
            departure by bringing “but” to the front of his sentence. He
            canceled the internal “but,” squeezed an ampersand in front
            of it on the baseline, and, placing a caret at the beginning
            of the sentence, inserted “But” to give “But The morrow came

            &amp; passed” [step 1]. However, in a proofreading
            phase, he altered “passed” to “went” [2], thus repeating
            that same expression appearing two sentences earlier, and
            thereby using repetition to give the sentences an impact of
            weariness. But either at the same time or at a later moment,
            he canceled “went” and inserted “the weary day passed by”
            [3], which makes the weariness explicit but also retains

          <p>HM's first impulse is to move directly to
            Tommo's internalized monologue, with something in
            mind like “Something detains him.” But he interrupts that
            thought, inscribing only “Something detains” [step 1],
            cancels the two words, and continues on with the rest of his
            sentence [2]. In doing so, he first establishes
            Tommo's resistance to despair with “Even yet I
            would not despair” and then moves on to the internalized
            monologue. The effect is to create a distinction between
            Tommo's critical self-distancing (“I would not
            despair”) and the actual moment of his brave resistance,
            rendered through speech (“Something detains him,” etc.).
            Later, in a proofreading phase, HM considered the idea of
            revising “Even yet” to “But” [3], but he canceled that
            insertion [4] as soon as he wrote it and before he could
            cancel “Even yet,” probably because it comes too close to
            the already inserted “But” that opens the sentence a few
            lines up (see RS12ms87). In the pencil substage, HM or his
            brother Gansevoort used pencil to cancel “once more” [5] and
            inserted also in pencil the letters <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">g</hi>, probably to indicate
            “again” (the wording found in the English edition).</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM revised his sentence thoroughly,
            in at least six places [6], all of which has the effect of
            converting the direct monologue to the more critically
            distant indirect monologue. The primary revision was the
            insertion of “I thought that” and two other <hi rend="italics">that</hi>s, which converts the independent
            clauses into a series of dependent clauses. And he shifted
            the new compound sentence from present tense to past, by
            converting “detains” to “detained,” “waits” to “was waiting

          <p>HM initially inscribes a full sentence, beginning at the

            reference to Proverbs 13:12: “Hope deferred maketh the heart
            sick” [step 1]. The words “I had” in HM's sentence
            are conjectural, as all but half of the last letter is
            obliterated by a tear in the MS leaf. An unusually large
            space on the baseline after this sentence and before the
            next sentence indicates that HM may have paused for a spell
            in his writing. (Perhaps he checked his Bible to verify the
            accuracy of his reference.) In the pencil substage, HM or
            Gansevoort placed a penciled dot in the margin to the right
            of this line and canceled (also with pencil) “to my fate”
            [2]. At a later point, HM canceled the phrase in ink [3].

            sentence with the preceding sentence by adding a semi-colon.

          <p>The revision in this sentence [step 1] can be coordinated
            with four other revision sites (as well as two sites in
            which HM made no change) on this MS leaf, all related to the
            same set of four key words: <hi rend="italics">companion,
              comrade, Toby,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">him</hi> (all
            but the one at this site referring to the absent Toby). It
            is clear that HM is tinkering throughout this scene in order
            to achieve the most euphonious disbursement of these words
            and to avoid placing certain unavoidable repetitions in too
            close proximity. No doubt, several hypotheses can be offered
            to account for the chain reaction of revision that probably
            occurred when HM focused specifically on this pesky,
            somewhat dreary problem with which all writers are familiar.
            The following scenario of how HM attempted to reduce
            repetition of the four key words is plausible enough;
            however, it may have occurred over several non-consecutive
            periods of time and not at one moment. This particular
            hypothesis has the advantage of accounting for all changes
            and non-changes as one proceeds down the MS page, but there
            is no assurance that HM followed that route. (Also, this
            hypothesis does not concern itself with three instances of
            the unrevised word “he” that Tommo uses in interior dialogue
            to denote Toby.)</p>
          <p>If we look down the MS page and assume that HM made none of
            these particular revisions until after he was done composing
            the page itself (that is, he did not revise any of the key
            words immediately as he wrote), we find on the MS leaf
            before us a certain pattern of disbursement. HM initially
            used the four key terms in seven instances throughout the
            leaf's 38 lines of text in the following sequence:
            “his unfortunate comrade” (line 7, RS12ms93), “my comrade”
            (line 15, RS12ms95), “Toby” (line 22, RS12ms96), “my poor
            companion” (line 23, RS12ms97), “my lost comrade” (line 34,
            RS12ms106), and “my companion” (line 37, RS12ms108). If HM
            proceeded down the MS page proofreading to seek out
            revisable infelicities, he would not have run into a serious
            repetition until line 15, where “my comrade” repeats line
            7's “his unfortunate comrade.” Even though
            Tommo's first usage of “comrade” refers to himself
            and the second to Toby, the repetition is still heard, and
            perhaps to distinguish the two referents as well as to
            eliminate repetition, HM at this point returned to line 7
            and made the first of two revisions at that site by changing
            “comrade” to “companion” [step 2]; then, back on line 15, he
            revised the second instance of “comrade” to “Toby” (see
            RS12ms95). But while this resolved one problem, it created
            another redundancy a few lines down in line 22, where HM had
            already used the word “Toby.” He canceled this “Toby,”
            placed a caret at the end of the preceding line, and
            inserted there the words “my companion” (see RS12ms96). But
            this revision created yet another repetition nearby with “my
            poor companion” in line 23, which HM canceled, substituting
            the word “him” (see RS12ms97).</p>
          <p>At this point HM may have followed one of two routes. Most
            likely, he reviewed his revisions at this point and found
            the new sequence of references to be “his unfortunate
            companion” (line 7), “Toby” (line 15), “my companion” (line
            22), and “him” (line 23). Seeing the repetition in lines 7
            and 22, he probably returned to line 7 and made the second
            revision at that site by canceling the inserted “companion”
            and restoring “comrade” [step 3] by placing a caret at the
            end of the preceding line and inserting “comrade” above the
            word “unfortunate.” This would then result in the sequence:
              <hi rend="italics">comrade, Toby, companion, him</hi>. He
            then would have continued down the page to line 37, leaving
            two references on lines 31 and 34 to “Toby” and “my lost
            comrade,” respectively unrevised. On line 37, he completed
            the process by revising “my companion” to “him” (RS12ms108).
            Or a second possibility: after revising line 23, HM may have
            continued to the bottom of the leaf, also skipping the two
            references on lines 31 and 34, and made the revision of “my
            companion” to “him” in line 37. At this point in this second
            possibility, HM would have reviewed the entire page and
            found the following sequence of terms: <hi rend="italics">companion, Toby, companion, him, Toby, comrade, him</hi>.
            He then would have returned to line 7 and revised
            “companion” to “comrade” [step 3] in order to eliminate the
            repetition in line 22. In either event, the final sequence
            of terms—<hi rend="italics">comrade, Toby, companion, him,
              Toby, comrade, him</hi>—reduces repetition and maximizes
            distance between reiterations.</p>

            render “whom I just cursed” [2] and then continues on with
            the rest of his clause. In a proofreading phase, HM quickly
            recognized the repetition of “heart” within the sentence and
            revised “heart of the valley” to “midst of the valley” [3].
            Either at the same time, or later, he further revised by
            adding “indeed” [4] for emphasis and changing “cursed” [5]
            to the less emphatic “censured.”</p>

            introductory clause and with it any mention of censure or
            bitterness, replacing it with “or he might be.” And he
            revised “in the midst of the valley” to “in some other part
            of the valley,” perhaps because Tommo himself is situated in
            the midst of the valley and Toby would therefore have to be

            “my very soul” [2], thus intensifying Tommo's
            apprehension. The implication is that the “fate” which
            causes the “very” soul to shudder is cannibalism.</p>

            Elsewhere, HM has also played with the word “fate”: in one
            instance he removed it from a reference to “sisters and
            brothers … fated” never to see Tommo (see RS12e101), and in
            another, he removed “to my fate” in MS and reinserted it
            later in fair copy (see RS12ms91 and e137). Here, however,
            “that fate” is reserved exclusively for Toby,
            Tommo's former intimate now possibly cannibalized
            [RN12e146]. Also at this site, HM tinkered with his
            sentence, revising “or dreadful to think may have met” to
            the more intense “or, more dreadful still, might have met”
            [RN12e145], and converting “soul shudders within me” to

            or designate a possible new paragraph. In this instance, HM
            added a second dash connected to the first. The implication
            is that with the first dash he had paused in his writing
            (perhaps for the day), and upon his return he added the
            second dash and continued on with his paragraph-concluding
            sentence, inadvertently inscribing “had had disappeared”
            [step 1]. In a proofreading phase, HM tinkered and
            corrected. In changing “reflections” to “speculations” [2],
            he further characterizes Tommo's thinking as more
            emotional. At the same time, he no doubt noticed the
            repeated <hi rend="italics">had</hi>s and deleted the
            second, giving “had disappeared” [3]. Either at the same
            time, or in a still later proofreading phase, he struck out
            “disappeared” with a wavy line and added “gone” [4]. (The
            inscribing of “gone” in this instance does not resemble the

          <p>HM made heavy proofreading revisions here, first in the
            usual manner of cancellation and insertion above the line
            and then down the length of the left margin with additional
            insertions along the way; he then finally transferred his
            revised text onto a now-lost slip of paper which he attached
            to the top of the MS leaf.</p>
          <p>Initially HM composes his sentence with no immediate
            revision: “But now that he was gone, they appeared to
            multiply their acts of kindness towards me showering upon me
            a degree of attention … celestial visitant” [step 1]. Quite
            possibly, the seemingly inconsequential trigger for the
            later revisions to the first half of the sentence was the
            desire, in a proofreading phase, to eliminate the repetition
            of “me” in “towards me showering upon me.” HM altered “me”
            to “myself” [2] by writing “yself” over “me,” but then
            canceled the cobbled word, writing “myself” afresh above the
            line for clarity. At this time, he may have also set about
            giving more specificity to the sentence by eliminating
            pronouns: he made the routine change of “he” to “my
            companion” [3, see also RS12ms93], and the more problematic
            change of “they” to “the savages” [4], by crossing out the
              <hi rend="italics">y</hi> in “they” and inserting
            “savages” above “appeared to” on the following line. Here,
            HM's text would have read “But now that my
            companion was gone, the savages appeared to multiply their
            acts of kindness towards myself showering upon me,” etc. At
            this point, HM then revised “the savages appeared to
            multiply their acts of kindness,” most likely in three
            steps: he canceled in separate strokes both “savages” and
            “appeared to,” squeezed “islanders” to the right of the
            former and above the latter, and altered “multiply” to
            “multiplied” by writing “ied” over “y,” thus giving “the
            islanders multiplied their acts of kindness” [5]. The effect
            is to tone down the ominous feel of “savages appearing” to
            be kind.</p>
          <p>Probably in a separate proofreading phase, and certainly
            after he had filled his MS page with text, HM reconceived
            the entire sentence. He canceled “But now that my companion
            was gone, the islanders,” placed a square diamond insertion
            device around a now-obscured, undeciphered letter, and began
            composing a new version down the left-hand margin of the
            MS leaf. (He does not, however, place a corresponding
            insertion device in the margin.) In the margin, he begins by
            writing “But whatever they might have thought of my
            companion, now that he” [6], with the idea of finishing the
            thought with “now that he was gone.” But he stops in
            mid-thought at the word “he”: the idea of evoking the
            islanders' attitude toward Toby was perhaps
            inappropriate in this context or quite possibly too
            revealing of Tommo's resentment of some
            preferential treatment by the islanders. In revising as he
            composes his marginal insertion, he first cancels “of my
            companion, now that he” and inscribes beneath the
            cancellation new language: “the fate that Toby had received”
            [7], thus giving “But whatever they might have thought the
            fate that Toby had received.” But this still emphasizes the
            islanders' point of view; HM, therefore, cancels
            “they” and “thought,” inserting “been” above “thought” to
            give “But whatever might have been the fate that Toby had
            received” [8]. Continuing on, HM then composes afresh,
            adding “at their hands, the natives” with the idea of moving
            directly back to the baseline word “multiplied” (the main
            predicate of his sentence) to give “But whatever might have
            been the fate that Toby had received at their hands, the
            natives multiplied their acts of kindness,” etc. But, again,
            he interrupts himself in mid-thought at “the natives,”
            cancels the two words, and interjects “now that he was gone
            the natives” [10], which merely delays his main sentence
            subject, “the natives.” At this point, HM's new
            sentence reads “But whatever might have been the fate that
            Toby had received at their hands[,] now that he was gone [,]
            the natives multiplied their acts of kindness towards
            myself.” In all, the revision, while it neutralizes
            “savages” with “natives,” nevertheless still contains an
            element of suspicion towards the islanders. Either upon
            completion of his marginal insertion, or later upon
            assessing the messiness of the MS page, he copied the text
            of his revision, or some version of it, onto a slip of
            paper, which he then straight-pinned to the top of the
            MS leaf. It is probably at this point that he canceled the
            square diamond insertion device [11], since the slip would
            have covered the revision area and its placement would have
            been obvious. Later still, perhaps when the entire MS was
            being fair-copied, the copyist may have removed the
            insertion slip and torn the top of the MS leaf, removing
            with it the paragraph symbol that appears at the beginning
            of this revision site.</p>

            slip or later in his fair-copy stage. In either event, “the
            fate that Toby had received at their hands” was revised to
            simply “his fate” [12], which effectively removes the
            implication that the natives did, in fact, harm Toby. In

            “showering upon me” to “treating me with.” And he revised
            “attention they could hardly have surpassed” to “deference
            which could hardly have been surpassed” (RS12e157-158),

            so, “never for a moment” implies a constant loyalty; whereas
            “never for the moment” suggests a kind of ad hoc servitude,
            hinting at Kory-Kory's divided loyalties between
            his new friend Tommo and the larger community. In a

            making several false starts. Initially, he writes “in the
            cool of the morning at” [step 1], probably getting ahead of
            himself with “at” instead of “&amp; at.” Canceling “at”

          <p>This complicated revision site reveals a full range of
            mental events including the recollection of the past, the
            correction of a dangling modifier, and a reconsideration of
            the politics and religion implied in the image of “Little
            Henry.” Although the passage is not canceled here, HM
            eventually rejected it, because of the inappropriateness of
            the image.</p>
          <p>HM first composed the sentence with virtually no immediate
            revision: “Oftentimes when borne by him through the shady
            paths of this valley I have thought of the picture of
            ‘Little Henry &amp; his bearer’ that usualy decorates
            the title page of that pleasing religious tract” [step 1].
            The only revision occurring during the initial phase of
            composition seems to be the conversion of “this” in “this
            valley” to “the” by the writing of an <hi rend="italics">e</hi> over the <hi rend="italics">i</hi> in “this” and the
            canceling of <hi rend="italics">s</hi> [2]. But later, in a
            proofreading phase, HM recast the entire sentence with a new
            focus on humor but in the passive voice, laboring through
            various false starts on an insertion that traverses the
            distance from left to right margin above the baseline. To do
            this, he canceled “I have thought” in two strokes, and
            placing a caret before the canceled “I have” begins his
            insertion with “my sa” [3], with the idea of saying
            something like “my sadness was diverted by the humorous
            picture of ‘Little Henry.’” Canceling “sa,” he next
            inscribes “dejection” [4], but immediately cancels that as
            well, returning to “sadness” and continuing on with “my
            sadness was diverted by the humorous” [5], placing a second
            caret after the canceled “I have” on the baseline. Probably,
            his strategy at this point was to cancel “of the” to render
            something like “the humorous picture of ‘Little Henry,’” but
            instead he rethinks the matter, cancels “humorous” and
            continues on with “remembrance” [6]. Now, his insertion
            reads “my sadness was diverted by the remembrance of the
            picture of ‘Little Henry &amp; his bearer,’” etc., and
            seemingly satisfied with this, he placed a third caret after
            the canceled “thought,” again on the baseline. Even so, he
            tinkers with “remembrance,” canceling that word and then
            inscribing the words “calling to remembrance” [7], which he
            immediately revises to “calling to mind” [8], by canceling
            the second “remembrance” and inserting beneath it the word
            “mind.” At this time, he probably cancels his third
            insertion caret and the word “of” which follows it [9] to
            give “my sadness was diverted by calling to mind the picture
            of ‘Little Henry &amp; his bearer,’” etc. To complete
            his recast sentence, he inserts “pleasurably” [10] to give
            “pleasurably diverted,” but having no space above the
            baseline, he makes the insertion in the space above the
            baseline of the preceding line.</p>
          <p>HM continued to revise the latter half of the sentence.
            Sensing the repetition of <hi rend="italics">that</hi>s in
            “that usualy decorates the title page of that pleasing
            religious tract,” he revised the second instance of the word
            to “the” [11], thus giving “the pleasing religious tract.
            However, he also converted the first “that” to “which” [12],
            which may have triggered his decision to return “the” back
            to “that pleasing religious tract” [13]. Perhaps unhappy
            with the rhythm of this closing expression, HM canceled
            “religious” and then added “&amp; popular religious” to
            give “that pleasing &amp; popular religious tract” [14].
            He probably chose at this time also to expand this to “that
            pleasing &amp; popular religious tract so denominated”
            [15], but immediately thought better of this, and canceled
            “so denominated” [16]. In a final move, he returned to
            review his heavily revised sentence and changed “borne by
            him” to “borne on his back” [17], to remind readers how
            “Little Henry” was borne by his “bearer.”</p>

        <div id="RN12e164" synch="RS12ms116e164" type="narr">
          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM dropped this sentence altogether
            [18]. Quite possibly, the simple reason is that the picture
            HM alludes to shows Little Henry being borne about like a
            babe in arms rather than Sinbad-like on his
            bearer's back the way Kory-Kory carries Tommo. But
            as Bryant argues in <hi rend="italics">Melville and
            Repose</hi> (157-60), HM's vivid recollection of
            the picture (as inaccurate as it was) overpowered his
            recollection of the Sunday school tract's promotion
            of an imperialistic, evangelical, and antithetical ideology.
            It was not until after composing and revising this working
            draft of <hi rend="italics">Typee</hi> that HM began to
            research Polynesian life and history more thoroughly. No
            doubt his rage against Western policies and atrocities grew
            the more he researched, and there is little doubt that he
            subsequently expanded the first ten chapters of his book by
            adding two chapters' worth of new and highly
            polemical material, including the famous attacks upon
            missionaries that eventually incited reactions from the
            religious press and expurgations by his own editor. Since
            “Little Henry and His Bearer” was a famous call to arms
            enlisting support for missionary work among England and
            America's children, HM may have removed the
            reference to Little Henry because he did not want the
            maudlin and imperialistic associations it contained to
            interfere with his depiction of the Typees.</p>
          <p>Hershel Parker offers a complementary explanation: HM
            included the passage, he argues, to tease his more pious
            sister Augusta (Parker 363-64). Presumably, when the private
            joke was read by family members and the hits were scored, he
            obligingly removed the teasing passage before going to
            print. Surely, the initial insertion, then removal, of
            “humorous” supports the idea that HM had a comic conception
            of the serious religious tract, although it seems clear that
            by removing the word, he was more likely concealing his
            satiric strategy from a public, not private, audience.</p>

            Thus, HM no longer needed the expanded characterization of
            “affectionate valet,” and in his fair-copy stage, he reduced
            the expression back to “he” [RN12e166]. Also at this time he

          <p>HM continued with his description of the stream without
            immediate revision [step 1], creating a series of three <hi rend="italics">which-</hi> clauses that he would
            eventually trim down to two main clauses and only one <hi rend="italics">which-</hi> clause. In addition, at this
            site and others on MS pages 30 and 31, he rearranged the
            sequencing of his “water words”: brook, stream, and waters.</p>
          <p>In a proofreading phase, HM made a series of changes to the
            diction and structure of his sentence. He revised “canopy
            over” to “canopy above” [2], probably to eliminate the
            repetition with “over head” on the same line. Despite this
            effort, the new (and less accurate) preposition creates a
            redundancy later on in the sentence with “one of [the rocks]
            projected … above the surface.” He also revised “stream
            which was strewn” to “stream that was strewn” [3] and then,
            perhaps at the same time, compressed this to “stream strewn”
            [4]. Tightening his second <hi rend="italics">which-</hi>
            clause, he altered “projected” to “projecting” by writing
            “ing” over the “ed” in “projected,” and canceled the now
            unworkable ampersand in “&amp; presented” [5]. In a
            final proofreading change, he revised “cavity” to the
            misspelled “bason” [6].</p>
          <p>In the pencil substage, HM or his brother Gansevoort placed
            a penciled dot in the margin to the right of line 23,
            indicating the need for some kind of revision. The penciled
            dot (which may be paired with RS12ms132-133e183-184)
            highlights one in an extended series of revision sites
            dealing with the words <hi rend="italics">stream,
            water(s)</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">brook</hi>, which HM
            used in describing Tommo's frequent visits to the
            river. Initially, in line 12, HM had announced two of his
            key terms (<hi rend="italics">stream</hi> and <hi rend="italics">waters</hi>) with “carrying me to the
            stream &amp; bathing me in its waters.” In lines 18 and
            20, he alternated these two words with “carry me to a
            particular part of the stream” and “At this place the waters
            flowed,” respectively. But from this point on, he uses
            “stream” redundantly in lines 24, 36, 38, and line 7 of
            MS page 31. Only in lines 31.2 and 31.10 does he return to
            an alternating pattern with the use of “water.” Thus, in his
            initial composition, HM had created a highly repetitive
            sequence of terms: <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> and <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (line 12), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (18), <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (20),
              <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (24), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (36), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (38),
              <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (p. 31.2), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (31.7), and <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (31.10). Quite possibly, then, the penciled
            dot earmarks the words “rushing stream” and the need to vary
            his overuse of “stream.”</p>
          <p>HM's revision of this series occurred in at least
            two phases. The one revision that triggered the other
            revisions, however, did not occur at this penciled dot
            point; rather, it probably occurred in line 38. At that
            site, in proofreading the words “this romantic stream,” HM
            would have easily heard the repetition of “antics in the
            stream” just two lines up. Canceling “stream,” he inserted
            “brook” above, introducing for the first time his third key
            word (see RS12ms130). Returning to “antics in the stream” in
            line 36, however, he may have recalled the <hi rend="italics">stream/water</hi> alternation at the top of
            the page, and also thinking that “antics” are more suitably
            performed (for whatever reason) in the broader context of
            “water,” he canceled “stream,” placed a caret after the
            cancellation, and inserted “water” above (see RS12ms128). He
            then restored the word “stream” in line 38 by canceling the
            inserted “brook” and inscribing to the left the word
            “stream” again, this time with a caret beneath it to mark
            its placement (see RS12ms130). At this point, the terms are
            now revised to give a pattern of perfect alternation: <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> and <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (line 12), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (18),
              <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (20), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (24), <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (36), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (38), <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (31.2), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (31.7),
            and <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (31.10).</p>
          <p>HM probably let these revisions sit for a while. But the
            regularity of the sequence may have struck him as tedious.
            At this point, he or someone else placed the penciled dot in
            the margin to the right of line 23, and another in the
            margin to the right of line 31.7 (see RS12ms133), to
            indicate a possible revision of these key words. Later, HM
            returned to both sites and in ink changed the word “stream”
            in both lines to “brook.” Here in line 23, he canceled
            “stream,” which actually appears at the beginning of line
            24, and inserted “brook” [step 8], in order to eliminate the
            tongue-twisting “stream strewn” to “brook strewn,” which
            also now creates a double alliteration with “smooth black
            rocks.” This resulted in a final two-part rhythm sequence in
            which <hi rend="italics">stream/water</hi> and <hi rend="italics">brook/water</hi> alternate: <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> and <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (line 12), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (18),
              <hi rend="italics">waters</hi> (20), <hi rend="italics">brook</hi> (23), <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (36), <hi rend="italics">stream</hi> (38), <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (31.2), <hi rend="italics">brook</hi> (31.7),
            and <hi rend="italics">water</hi> (31.10).</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM continued to adjust sentence
            structure and modify his use of his “water words” [9]. He
            converted “above the rushing brook strewn here and there
            with smooth black rocks” to a main clause—“near the stream
            were several smooth black rocks”—attaching it to the
            preceding clause with a semi-colon. In doing so, he
            eliminated the redundant “above” problem created when in
            step 2 he revised “over” to “above” and also revised “brook”
            back to its original word, “stream.” In forming his new main
            clause, he necessarily had to refashion the following <hi rend="italics">which-</hi> clause to a clause as well, and
            did so by converting “one of which” to “One of these,”
            adding “of the water” to “surface” to give “surface of the
            water,” and revising “presented” to “had” [RN12e171]. He
            also revised “bason” back to his original word “cavity” and
            deleted “picturesque &amp;” from “picturesque &amp;
            delightful couch” to give simply “delightful couch.”</p>

          <p>In a proofreading phase and seemingly less concerned with
            the grammar of <hi rend="italics">lie</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lay</hi> than with the idea that Tommo
            should appear amply dressed beside Fayaway, HM revised his
            simple statement describing his tryst with Fayaway [step 1]
            by inserting “covered by an ample robe of Tappa” [2]. Most
            likely, his revision here triggered the revision of “ample
            robe of tappa” to “large robe” two MS pages farther down
            (see RS12ms146). In a later proofreading phase, he
            subsequently reduced the amplitude of dress by canceling
            this insertion and inscribing a second version down the
            right margin: “covered with a gauze-like veil of tappa” [3].
            He then drew a vertical line from the insertion to his
            original caret to indicate its proper placement. In this
            revised insertion, Tommo is fully covered, but with
            see-through material; thus, HM is able to balance innocence
            and eroticism. But to eliminate a repetition with “with
            Faaua” in the following line, HM revised again, changing
            “covered with” in his new insertion to “covered by” [4].
            Despite these tinkerings, the sentence's solecism
            and somewhat faulty parallelism (“Here I would lay for hours

            (see also RS12e177, 178, and 179). HM was not fastidious in
            distinguishing between <hi rend="italics">lie</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lay</hi>. Although in changing “would” to
            “often,” he effectively converted “lay” from an improper to

            may have been simply to indicate the frequency of his time
            spent with Fayaway not to correct the (unperceived)
            solecism. Also, he changed “&amp; with Faaua” to “while
            Fayaway” (in coordination with RS12e179) and added “and”
            before “holding in her hand” to give “while Fayaway, seated
            beside me, and holding in her hand” [RN12e176]. In doing so,
            he was also able to return “by a gauze-like veil” back to

            written “occasional” (for “occasionally”) and continued on

            occasional aside the insects that occasionaly lighted on my

            to make “occasionaly brushed” [2]. The sentence is clearly
            overloaded with one too many “occasionally's,” but
            HM may have intentionally inscribed both to experiment with
            his adverb placement. In due course, he canceled the first
            “occasionaly” [3] so that Fayaway is always brushing aside
            the occasional insect. In a separate proofreading phase, he
            revised “brow” to “face” [4], perhaps to reduce an unwanted

            so, he also moved “while” farther up the sentence, where he
            used it as a substitute for “&amp; with” in “&amp;
            with Fayaway” (see RS12e176). These strategic revisions have
            two effects: they place Fayaway and Kory-Kory in separate
            spheres; and they create a more coherent sentence structure.
            In this regard, instead of the messy “&amp; with Faaua
            seated … while Kori Kori performed” structure, the sentence
            now hangs together more tightly with “while Fayaway …
            brushed … and Kory-Kory performed.”</p>

          <p>The difference in the inking of this line in comparison to
            that before it suggests that HM had paused at this point
            before continuing his inscription. Perhaps during this time
            he made proofreading revisions to sections of this MS leaf.
            In any event, he composed this sentence without any
            immediate changes [step 1]. However, in a proofreading
            phase, he deleted “here” from “here presented” [2], thus
            removing a somewhat academic tone. Either before or after
            this revision, but in a series of revisions coordinated with
            others on this and the following MS page (see RN12ms120), HM
            first revised “stream” to “brook” [3], and then restored
            “stream” [4]. Chances are, HM added paragraph marks to his
            MS late in the process, after his proofreading phases, and
            this revision site provides some evidence of that.
            Typically, in this late paragraph substage, HM would place a
            paragraph mark to the left of the opening word. However, at
            this revision site, his lengthy vertical insertion down the
            left-hand margin (see RS12ms109) gives him no room to do
            this, and he had no recourse but to squeeze his paragraph
            mark uncharacteristically above and after the opening word
            “As,” located at the beginning of his line [5]. But this
            small paragraph mark is not as prominent as his other marks,
            so he reinscribes a much larger mark after the word “us” at
            the end of the preceding sentence [6]. Since this placement
            of the paragraph mark must have come after the marginal
            revisions to the left, and since those marginal revisions
            themselves came late in the revision process, it can be said
            with some degree of certainty that HM's insertion
            of paragraph marks was one of the last manipulations of this
            draft he made. Parker, however, feels that HM “inserted
            clear paragraph symbols as he went” (361).</p>

            stream” [7] focuses the eye more logically on the stream

            of paper to insert more neatly inscribed versions of

            redundancy (and parallelism) of “would anoint,” but gives
            more focus to the habitual anointing ritual being described.

          <p>Beginning one of the more sensual passages in the novel, HM

            that they squeezed from a roo” [step 1], stopping himself in
            mid-word to revise the false start on “root” to “yellow
            root” [2]. Continuing on with “yellow root that they,” he
            stops again sensing, no doubt, the repetition of <hi rend="italics">that they</hi>s he has just created.
            Canceling “they” [3], he also converts his first “that they”
            to “which they” [4], but then almost immediately conceives
            of a tighter structure and cancels “which they” [5]
            altogether. Continuing on with his sentence, he now has “a
            fragrant oil squeezed from a yellow root that had previously
            been pounded,” etc. Moving on to a second sentence, he stops
            again at “when applied to the” [6]. Immediately canceling
            “the,” he continues on with “one's limbs by the
            soft palms of sweet nymphs” [9] and finishes his sentence.
            In a proofreading phase, HM inscribed a capital <hi rend="italics">A</hi> over the lower-case <hi rend="italics">a</hi> in “and” to indicate a new sentence.
            Probably at the same time, he also tinkered with his
            Polynesian orthography, revising the two instances of “aka”
            to “aker” [8], by squeezing “er” over the final <hi rend="italics">a.</hi> HM may have altered the word to
            make it conform to his own northeastern dialect in which
            final “ah” sounds come out “er” as in “idear” for “idea.”

            that had previously been pounded” to simply “yellow root
            previously pounded” (RN12e191). Finally, to reduce the
            repetition of “delight” in the sentence (see also RN12e194

            highly racy compound sentences. Initially, HM reconceives
            the first sentence as he writes. He stops his opening—“With
            Captain Macheath in the opera I could have sung ‘Thus I lay
            like a Turk with my doxies around,’ for never certainly did”
            [step 1]—in mid-thought with something in mind like “for
            never certainly did effeminate ottoman [or perhaps ‘I’]
            experience such sensations.” Canceling “did,” he inserts
            above it the word “was,” and continues expanding on his
            image with “never was effeminate ottoman” and completes his
            sentence. He also at this time completes his second compound
            sentence concerning “Sardanaplaus” [2]. In a proofreading
            phase, he thought better of the comparative clause “than
            happened to me on these occasion I have mentioned.” The
            direct implication of himself in the sexual acts alluded to
            here may have been too immodest, and censoring himself, he
            canceled the passage [3]. (It is also possible that he made
            this cancellation in the pencil substage.) At a later point,
            during the pencil substage, HM or perhaps Gansevoort also
            thought better of the reference to the wily and amorous con
            man MacHeath in John Gay's <hi rend="italics">The
              Beggar's Opera</hi>. That pencil-wielding person
            vigorously canceled the first main clause with one long
            series of loops [4]. Also in pencil, the conjunction “for”
            is canceled, and “never” is capitalized to create a new
            sentence. Later on, HM sustained these emphatic suggestions
            for revision by making the same changes in ink [5].</p>

            (364). But if the pencil cancellation (which Parker does not
            mention) came before any private readings of the text, it is
            more likely that HM wrote the passage primarily to titillate
            himself, a notion supported by Parker's subsequent

          <p>HM revised his sentence considerably. He begins with a
            lengthy sentence structure in mind. Initially, he writes
            that Kory-Kory “would assist me … in front of the house
            &amp; protecting my limbs from the annoyance of the
            insects that occasionly hovered in the air by tucking me
            about with an ample robe of tappa” [step 1]. In a
            proofreading phase, he added detail to the scene in a
            two-step process: first he converted “&amp; protecting”
            to “protect,” and then he began inserting a new phrase but
            inscribed only “&amp; seating me cu(?)” [2]. The “cu(?)”
            is all that can be made out of what appears to be a canceled
            adverb (“comfortably”?); however, it cannot be deciphered
            because a tear in the MS obliterates the rest of the word.
            Canceling his adverb (probably as soon as he writes it), he
            finishes his insertion so that it reads “&amp; seating
            me near its edge would protect” [3]. Either at the same
            time, or in separate proofreading phases, HM also revised
            “limbs” to “body” [4] and “an ample robe of tappa” to “a
            large robe of tappa” [5]. “Ample robe of tappa” is an
            expression that HM seems to want to use somewhere in his
            text; it occurs in two similar scenes—Fayaway's
            consoling of Tommo two pages earlier (see RS12ms124) and
            Kory-Kory's ministrations here—and the revisions to
            them are probably connected. Chances are the present
            instance of “ample” was the first to be inscribed.
            HM's idea is simply to show that Tommo is fully
            covered and in native dress, but since HM is in the presence
            of another male, the amplitude of coverage is not as
            significant an issue as it would be if Tommo were in the
            presence of a female. Quite possibly, this thought or
            something like it triggered HM's return to
            Tommo's earlier scene with Fayaway in which he at
            first is simply lying beside Fayaway. In this scenario, HM,
            then, canceled the phrase “ample robe of Tappa” found here
            and transfered it to the Fayaway scene in order to cover
            Tommo with the same “ample robe.” Eventually, though, the
            “ample robe” there becomes a more mysterious and seductive
            “gauze-like veil of tappa.” Thus, in the end, HM's
            particular word “ample” is canceled in both revision

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM tinkered with the sentence a
            bit. He reduced “would protect” to “protect” by deleting the
            repeated “would.” He converted “that” to “which” and
            “tucking me about” to “wrapping me round.” The revision of
            “robe” to “roll” may not be intentional. It is possible that
            HM or someone assisting him in preparing the fair copy read
            “robe” as “role,” which in turn was “corrected” to
          “roll.”</p>

          <p>HM is composing new material. His initial strategy is to
            describe the officious Kory-Kory's adjusting of
            Tommo to meet his, not Tommo's, standards, and he
            revised and expanded the passage to dramatize
            Kory-Kory's antics. It is a good, well-executed
            joke in the vein of earlier burlesques of Kory-Kory;
            however, HM dropped the passage probably in fair copy.</p>
          <p>HM begins with a participial phrase, “Having adjusted
            everything to his satisfaction” [step 1], and pauses here to
            insert “own” to give “own satisfaction” [2] to establish
            early on the contrast between the master's and
            servant's wills. Continuing on with “for he always
            appeared to think I, being the interested” [3], he stops
            himself in mid-thought. His idea is to describe
            Kory-Kory's manner with something like “for he
            always appeared to think I, being the interested party,
            should not have my way —” and then to elaborate on
            Kory-Kory's bustling. However, recognizing
            (perhaps) that he is launching into an already overly nested
            sentence structure, and thinking (too) that he might relate
            the scene more effectively by opening with a more graphic
            dramatization of Kory-Kory's antics, he decides to
            invert his plan and begin again but now with the bustling up
            front. He cancels what he has written and rewrites his
            sentence entirely, stressing how Kory-Kory “would bustle …
            and employ” himself [4]. In a proofreading phase, HM shifts
            from the habitual “would” constructions to the simple past
            tense by dropping “would” and adding “d” to “bustle,” and
            “ed” to “employ.” He also substituted “around” for “about”
            and altered 10 to 20 minutes, giving us the final reading of
            “He then bustled around me and employed himself for at least
            20 minutes” [5]. In a separate proofreading phase, he
            tinkered with the end of his sentence to heighten the
            extremity of Kory-Kory's insistence, by inserting
            “by any means” and “own” [6]. He also changed “business” to
            “matter,” apparently not noticing the repetition created
            with “for in these matters.”</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage [7], HM essentially eliminates the
            humor in this scene, removing everything from “for in these
            matters” to the end of his sentence (RN12e205). The highly
            class-conscious joke casts Kory-Kory in the Western mold of
            the overly attentive colonial servant and continues the
            largely comic treatment of the “servitor.” Its removal
            effectively anticipates the more serious “work” Kory-Kory is
            about to do in the chapter's final scene devoted to
            the lighting of a fire; it lessens the caricature of
            Kory-Kory and establishes him as a positive, not debased,
            Polynesian contrast to Western culture. To complete his
            revisions of the remaining sentence, HM tinkered a bit,
            revising “around” to “about” and “that affected” to “to
            secure” (RN12e203-204).</p>

          <p>With this paragraph, HM launches into his description of
            Kory-Kory striking a “Light à la Typee” (as it is subtitled
            in the English edition). HM no doubt rehearsed this anecdote
            orally numerous times when regaling shipmates, family, and
            friends about his Polynesian experiences. Given the prior
            rehearsals, he may have been able to transcribe the tale
            onto paper without much need for revision, and that might
            account for the relatively “clean” state of the manuscript
            page. Even so, the MS records several false starts and
            adjustments. Here, HM first writes “Having perfected his
            arrangements, he would get my pipe &amp; striking a
            light” [step 1], but recognizes that his next words would
            have to be repetitive, something like “&amp; striking a
            light, light my pipe.” Canceling “striking a light,” he
            continues on with “&amp; lighting it hand it me to
            smoke” [2]. The elision of “to” in the indirect object “to
            me” in “hand it me to smoke” is an acceptable practice, but
            probably not intended.</p>

          <p>HM initially inscribes this sentence without immediate
            revision [step 1]. It stands in MS as the first of two
            somewhat repetitive introductions to the fire-lighting
            “operation,” which HM eventually reduced to one. Here, as in
            the earlier scene involving the females polishing coconuts
            (page 31), HM is particularly fond of the word “operation,”
            which stresses the industriousness of these preindustrial
            people. HM uses the word later in “Promethean operation”
            (RS12ms155) in the second (eventually canceled)
            introduction. No doubt because of this repetition, HM
            canceled “this operation” in a proofreading phase, revising
            it to “the mode he adopted” [2]. This revision may also be
            coordinated with the insertion of “operation” at

            “Europe &amp; posterity,” HM removes the adumbration of
            the “moral” of his anecdote appearing in the final
            paragraph. To clear up the ragged edges left by this major
            deletion, he also revised “what I had been led to suppose it
            was among savages I shall here record it” to “what I had
            ever seen or heard of before, I will describe it”
            (RN12e207), thus removing yet another use of “savage” from

          <p>HM revises as he composes. His idea is to describe the
            sticks used to start the fire and compare them to the
            West's “lucifer matches.” His initial thought is
            that the second piece of wood is half an inch wide, but he
            interrupts that thought, writing only “ha” for “half” [step
            1] and correcting it immediately to “an inch wide,”
            continues on with “an inch wide, is as invariably to be
            found” [2]. Coming to the word “found,” he realizes that he
            will want to use it again with the matches, cancels “found,”
            and finishes the sentence [3]. In a proofreading phase,
            probably just as he completed the sentence, he tinkered with
            his final image and revises “in a corner of the cupboard of
            our kitchens” to the more succinct “in the corner of a
            kitchen cupboard” [4]. Later, he added more detail to the
            first stick, inserting “denuded of the bark” and canceling
            “of” [5]. Given the highly sexualized nature of this
            fire-lighting scene, the choice of the word “denuded” is
            particularly apt. In the pencil substage, however, HM or
            perhaps the more grammatically astute Gansevoort placed a
            penciled dot to the left of the phrase “is to be found
            laying,” which he also canceled with looping pencil strokes
            [6]. Later, HM made the suggested cancellation in ink, thus
            removing the improper use of “laying” [7].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage [8], HM made several small but
            significant adjustments. He further clarified the first
            stick by revising “decomposed” to “decayed.” And in a small
            act of self-censorship, he substituted the botanical “of the
            Hibiscus” for his earlier suggestive insertion “denuded of
            the bark” to give “partly decayed stick of the Hibiscus”
            (RN12e209-210). He also deleted “properly furnished” from
            “properly furnished house,” perhaps for the sake of readers
            somewhat anxious about their home furnishings. In a similar
            vein, he deleted “here” from “here at home.” In this case,
            “here” primarily designates HM's actual home in
            Lansingburgh, where he composed most of the MS working
            draft. In print and with a full audience in mind, “here”
            drifts toward the designation of the place of publication,
            but since HM anticipated both English and then American
            publication, the dropped word removes any hint of a national
            designation. “At home” can mean anywhere. However, this
            small deletion might also be seen in the context of
            HM's revision of “artisan of our own country” to
            “European artisan” (see RS12e253) in his conclusion, where
            he seems explicitly to address a non-American audience. It
            is possible, too, that “here” was removed by an editor
            preparing the English edition.</p>

          <p>HM composes this paragraph—essentially a second
            introduction to the scene—with perhaps only one hesitation,
            at the end [step 1]. Here, inscribing “for the particular
            gratification,” his quill seems to slide from the last
            syllable of “gratification” to an undeciphered letter,
            perhaps a false start on “of,” with the intention of saying
            something like “for the particular gratification of the
            reader.” However, he cancels the false start, and modifies
            his phrase to “for his particular gratification” [2]. But
            this creates an ambiguous pronoun reference. The sentence
            proposes to introduce Kory-Kory to the reader, and “his” can
            refer to either. To solve the problem, HM revised “he” (i.e.
            Kory-Kory) to “the former” [2], making the reference to
            Kory-Kory explicit. The revision does not, however,
            eradicate all ambiguity, as “his particular gratification”
            may indicate either the reader's or
            Kory-Kory's pleasure. The effect of this remaining
            ambiguity is to create both a clever hint and cover-up of
            HM's sexual joking. The subsequent fire-lighting
            description is a not-too-subtle, but still often-missed,
            submerged depiction of male orgasm. It may therefore be
            entirely for Kory-Kory's (sexual) gratification
            (since it is he who performs the “operation”), or simply the
            reader's innocent (or then again voyeuristic)
            pleasure. In a separate proofreading phase (probably
            coordinated with RS12ms150), HM landed upon the happy idea
            of revising the merely serviceable “operation of striking a
            light” to “Promethean operation” [4], a brilliant image that
            provides the perfect mythic confluence of fire, sexuality,
            creativity, and rebellion for the concluding scene.</p>

          <p>However clever this second introduction may have been, or
            brilliant its Promethean imagery, HM thought best to omit it
            altogether [5], probably during his fair-copy stage. The
            reason may be twofold. The paragraph is a second, and
            arguably superfluous introduction: Tommo's stagy
            pretense of “introducing” Kory-Kory, whom we have known for
            several chapters, and the hint of sexual double-entendre,
            also draws attention to its odd presence, which in turn
            suggests more winking at the reader than HM may have wanted
            to risk. In addition, the first introduction offers (in its
            MS version) the adumbration of the more serious cultural
            discussion to come, and may be seen as the more serious,
            less daring opener for the politically (if not finally
            sexual) wordplay to come. The unfortunate loss in the
            deletion of this passage is, of course, the image of the
            “Promethean operation.” Although HM uses “operation” twice
            later on in the fire-lighting scene itself, he did not take
            the opportunity to upgrade either instance to the Promethean
            proportions indicated here.</p>

          <p>Kory-Kory's fire-lighting scene may well be based
            upon one of the anecdotes HM had rehearsed for sailors,
            family, and friends. Once he had introduced the scene, he
            launched into the ribald description itself, probably
            relying upon the wording of past oral performances; thus,
            the text in MS is inscribed with relatively few immediate or
            proofreading revisions. Still, HM made certain adjustments.
            In a proofreading phase, HM revised what appears to be the
            word “thus” in “thus grasping” [step 1] to “then grasping”
            [2]. (The initial word is in doubt because a small tear in
            the MS page obliterates part of the last letter of the word.
            HM has inscribed “n” over part of what appears to be a <hi rend="italics">u.</hi>) Perhaps at the same time, but in
            coordination with RS12ms159, HM also revised “stick” to the
            pronoun “one” to reduce the repetition of “stick” earlier
            and later in the sentence.</p>

          <p>HM completes the first sentence of his description without
            immediate revision [step 1]. In several proofreading phases,
            he made adjustments in the details and sentence structure.
            In one instance, he noted that he is not clear which stick
            is being rubbed, and he inserted “on the principal stick”
            [2] for the sake of clarification. With the word “stick” now
            appearing three times in the opening of his sentence, he no
            doubt turned to RS12ms158 to make the change there from
            “stick” to “one.” In a separate proofreading phase, he
            altered “he at last” to “at last he” [3] and revised the
            dependent clause “which runs from” to the participial phrase
            “running from” [4]. In the pencil substage, HM or his
            brother Gansevoort placed a penciled dot in the right
            margin, suggesting, perhaps, that further attention should
            be paid to the word “channel,” which is repeated on lines 11
            and 26 of the MS page [5]. However, HM does not seem to be
            interested so much in reducing the repetitions of this word
            as he is in clarifying the fire-lighting process by playing
            with the words “narrow” and “smoking.” When HM returned to
            his MS, he revised in ink “channel” to “narrow groove” [6],
            probably in coordination with the revision on line 11 of
            “narrow channel” to “smoking channel” (see RS12ms165). The
            coordinated revision renders a more effective use of the two
            adjectives, with “narrow” establishing earlier on the size
            of the groove and “smoking” later on indicating the
            increasing friction of the process. HM did not revise “the
            channel” in line 26 in order to reduce the redundancy with
            “smoking channel” in line 11. (Another possibility, however,
            is that the penciled dot refers to the sentence's
              <hi rend="italics">which</hi>- clause, eliminated in step

            he then capitalizes by inserting a capital <hi rend="italics">I</hi> over “in” [2]. His idea is probably
            to continue on with something like “In a while he gradually

            by inscribing “ut” over the <hi rend="italics">y</hi> in

            redundancy with “At first,” which now opens the sentence
            (see RS12e219). He also altered “his employment” to “the

            deleted “in which it plays” to eliminate the annoying “plays

            conversion of the almost metaphysical “a rapidity that
            blends them apparently into one” to the mundane “amazing
            rapidity.” An equal loss is the reduction of the second
            sentence —with its elaborate image of perspiration
            threatening “to extinguish as soon as it shall appear the
            feeble spark that he is endeavoring to elicit”—to the merely

            sanitized context: “approaches the climax of his efforts”
            [2]. In a proofreading phase, he inserted “pants” as either
            an alternative or compound verb in the second sentence, but
            did not add a conjunction or cancel “gasps” [3].</p>

          <p>In his fair-copy stage, HM tinkered with his sentence
            structure and made several small adjustments [4]. He
            combined the two sentences into a complex sentence by
            converting “But now he approaches” to “As he approaches.” He
            also converted “efforts” to “effort” and “his eyes protrude”
            to “and his eyes almost start” (RN12e227 and e229). In
            addition, he corrected the “pants gasps” problem by adding
            the conjunction “and” as well as the modifier “for breath,”
            to give what appears in the English edition as “pants and
            grasps for breath” (RN12e228). “Grasps for breath” may be an
            intended revision; indeed, given Kory-Kory's
            handiwork, it is a bit more appropriate for the scene. But
            “grasps” may be a misreading or typo that entered the text
            either in fair copy or during the preparation of the English
            edition. That the phrase becomes “gasps for breath” in the
            first American edition (which HM did not supervise) and in
            the American Revised edition (which he did) does not
            necessarily argue that HM finally intended “gasps for
            breath,” which is adopted by the NN editors, for “gasps”

            [step 1]. However, he stops himself in attempting his next
            sentence, writing what appears to be “the haustion,” which

          <p>HM is embarking upon his racy joke as to why there is no
            college of Vestal Virgins on the island to keep the eternal
            flame that would obviate the repeated act of fire-making.
            (The unexpressed punchline is that there are no virgins in
            the valley.) Perhaps his anxiety in getting the wording
            right accounts for the revisions here. HM first writes “I
            should have suggested to the tenants of the valley the
            propriety” [step 1], with the idea of saying something like
            “the propriety of establishing a college of vestals.” But
            stopping in mid-sentence, he recognizes that his suggestion
            would have to be made to the valley's leaders, not
            just its tenants. He therefore cancels “tenants of the
            valley the propriety” as soon as he writes it, substituting
            for it “most influential of the natives the prop” [2],
            interrupting himself in mid-thought yet again. Completing
            only “prop” for “propriety,” he cancels the false start, and
            revises “propriety” to “expedience.” Since HM is building to
            a joke about the nonexistence of Polynesian female
            virginity, the word “propriety” has some subtle ironic
            undertones; however, as further revisions show, HM submerges
            his joke to the point of obscurity, and the immediate shift
            during composition to the more matter-of-fact “expedience”
            partakes of this submergence. But HM has not yet completed
            his sentence; he continues on to yet another false start
            (failing to notice, as he turns over his sheet of paper,
            that he has inscribed “a” twice) with “expedience of
            establishing a a college of vestals to be located” [3].
            Canceling “located,” he writes “centrally located” and
            finishes the sentence without further interruption [4]. In a
            series of proofreading phases, HM tinkered with “natives,”
            first canceling “natives” at the beginning of the last line
            of the MS page and inserting above it the word “islanders”
            [5], but later canceling that insertion and restoring
            “natives” [6] by placing a caret at the end of the preceding
            line and squeezing the word “natives” in the right

            (with its understated banking associations), HM is ready to
            move directly to his conclusion, in which he will compare
            Polynesian and Western cultures. And he completes a full
            version of his transition sentence with “What a striking
            evidence this, of the difference between the extremes of
            savage and enlightened life?” [step 1]. However, the full
            comic potential of his college of vestals joke does not hit
            him until this moment. He cancels his transition sentence
            altogether and begins inscribing his punch line, basically
            insinuating that it would be difficult to have a Polynesian
            college of vestals because there are no virgins on the
            island, and further begging the reader not to make him be
            more explicit about this. But he pauses in rendering the
            conclusion of his sentence, stopping at “I beg” [2].
            Canceling “beg,” he finishes the sentence with “courteously
            beg I may be excused from more distinctly pointing out” [3].
            At this point, he probably canceled “courteously” [4],
            assuming that “I beg I may be excused” is courteous enough.
            In a proofreading phase, HM tinkered with his initial word
            “undertaking,” first substituting “enterprise” for it [5],
            accentuating the banking business association already
            established. He then considered restoring “undertaking,” by
            beginning to inscribe that word to the left of the inserted
            “enterprise.” However, he interrupts that thought in
            mid-word, writing only “un” [6], which he immediately
            cancels [7], thus retaining “enterprise.” In the pencil
            substage, HM or Gansevoort placed a penciled dot at the
            beginning of this line in the left-hand margin [8]. And
            later, HM returned to this site to make further revisions,
            probably to change the infelicitous “I beg I may” to “I beg
            to be excused” [9], by canceling “I may” and inserting “to”
            above it. At this time, he may have also restored
            “courtiously” (this time misspelled) by inserting it over
            the previously canceled “courteously.”</p>

            and opting for the opposite gambit, completes his sentence

            “While” to “whilst” (RN12e252) and the cumbersome “fifty
            times in the 24 hours” to “in one second” (RN12e254). The
            revision of “a poor artisan of our own country” to “a poor
            European artisan” (RN12e253) refocuses attention from
            America to Europe. Since HM wrote, initially, with a home
            audience in mind but was published first in England, this
            revision may have been made after he sent his fair copy off
            for review in England and perhaps as late as the page-proof
            stage, during which Gansevoort was authorized to make
            changes.</p>

          <p>Completing his image of the contrasting Western and
            Polynesian families, HM revises as he writes. Initially, he
            inscribes “is put to his wits' ends to provide the
            food for his starving brood that the children of Polenysia”
            [step 1], but stops himself here. While the generalized
            “children of Polenysia” places the island culture in
            parallel with “our country” in the preceding clause, he opts
            to stress the Polynesian parent as a parallel to “a poor
            artisan of our country.” Canceling the misspelled
            “Polenysia,” he tries out “the aforesaid Polynesian
            individual” [2], but probably finding that a bit stuffy,
            cancels that phrase as well. Attempting a third version,
            this time above the baseline, he inscribes the word “the”
            [3], perhaps going for something like “the aforesaid
            Polynesian father.” However, recognizing that he wants a
            generalized (not specific) father, he cancels “the” and
            writes the ingeniously misspelled “a Poleysnian father” also
            above the baseline, and then, returning to the baseline,
            completes his sentence [4]. In a proofreading phase, he
            altered “that” to “which” [5]. In his pencil substage, HM or
            Gansevoort canceled the word “the” in “the food,” but HM did
            not confirm the cancellation in ink. Quite possibly, the
            tentative deletion was to remind HM that he might consider
            “that food.”</p>

          <p>And indeed, in his fair-copy stage [7], HM revised “provide
            the food for his starving brood which” to “provide for his
            starving offspring that food which” (RN12e256). HM, or
            perhaps an editor preparing the English edition, made other
            changes for the sake of grammar or accuracy. “Parents” was
            altered to “parent” to agree with the singular father, and
            the unlikely “every surrounding tree” became “every tree
            around them” (RN12e257 and e258). In addition,
            “wits' ends” misses the familiar expression with
            its pluralized “ends”; however, the “correction” to
            “wit's end” (RN12e255) introduces an incorrect
            singular possessive. The NN edition emends the phrase to
            “wits' end.”</p>

          <p>HM's final paragraph emphatically commends the
            fire-lighting example to economists and philosophers devoted
            to “putting to rights this most imperfectly constituted
            plan[e]t of ours.” HM inscribes it with only a few mishaps;
            however, he deleted it completely from his final text. In
            the opening to the sentence, he writes “This single
            practical illustration is, I insist upon it, is” [step 1],
            inadvertently giving “is” twice. Canceling the second
            instance, he continues on with “worth volumes of
            philosophical theorizing” [2]. (Quite possibly, he did not
            correct the double “is” problem until a later proofreading
            phase.) Pausing at “philosophical theorizing,” he seems to
            have had second thoughts about specifying the theorizing as
            “philosophical,” and perhaps recognizing that he would
            invoke “public spirited Philosophers” later in his sentence,
            he revises “philosophical” to “learned” [3], and then
            “theorizing” to “disquisitions” [4], to give “learned
            disquisitions.” Continuing on with his sentence, he once
            again inadvertently doubles a word, in this case “putting to
            rights to.” Canceling the second “to” (which might also be a
            miswriting of the following word “this”), he finishes the
            sentence with “this most imperfectly constituted plant of
            ours” [5], inadvertently misspelling “planet” as “plant.” In
            a proofreading phase, he inserted “the” before “political
            economists” [6]. The insertion reinforces the restrictive
            nature of the <hi rend="italics">who-</hi> clause that
            follows. HM does not assume that “all” political economists
            and philosophers are engaged in righting the
            planet's wrongs; he commends his example only to
            “all those” thinkers who are so engaged.</p>

          <p>Quite possibly, HM censored himself in his fair-copy stage,
            by deleting the entire paragraph [7]. While the tone is
            jocular enough, it is also insistent, and for a piece of
            travel writing, perhaps too insistent. Given that his point
            is already made in the penultimate paragraph, he may have
            deemed the passage expendable, and needless to say, its
            removal is in keeping with other instances of toning
          down.</p>
