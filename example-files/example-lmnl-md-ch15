[excerpt [source}Moby Dick{] [author}Herman Melville{] [chapter [n}14{n] [title}Chowder{title] [page [n}73{n] [p [n}1{n] [s [l [q=i}"What's that about Cods, ma'am?"{q] said I, with much politeness.{l]{s]{p]
[p [n}2{n] [s [l [q=h}"Clam or Cod?"{q] she repeated.{l]{s]{p] 
[p [n}3{n] [s [l [q=i}"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean,{l] [l}[name=h}Mrs. Hussey?"{name]{q] says I; [q=i}"but that's a rather cold and clammy{l] [l}reception in the winter time, ain't it, [name=h}Mrs. Hussey{name]?"{q]{l]{s]{p] 
[p [n}4{n] [s [l}But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the{l] [l}purple shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming{l] [l}to hear nothing but the word "clam", [name=h}Mrs. Hussey{name] hurried{l] [l}towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out{l] [l}[q=h}"clam for two,"{q] disappeared.{l]{s]{p]
[p n}5{] [s [l}[q=i}"[name=q}Queequeg{name],"{q] said I, [q=i}"do you think that we can make out a{l] [l}supper for us both on one clam?"{q]{l]{s]{p]
[p [n}6{ [s [l}However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to{l] [l}belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when{l] [l}that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully{l] [l}explained.{s] [s}[diraddr}Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me.{diraddr]{s] [s}It was made of{l] [l}small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with{l] [l}pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes;{l] [l}the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with{l] [l}pepper and salt.{s] [s}Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty{l] [l}voyage, and in particular, [name=q}Queequeg{name] seeing his favourite fishing{l] [l}food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we{l] [l}despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a{l] [l}moment and bethinking me of [name=h}Mrs. Hussey's{name] clam and cod an{l][l}nouncement, I thought I would try a little experiment.{s] [s}Stepping{l] [l}to the kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with great em{l][l}phasis, and resumed my seat.{s] [s}In a few moments the savoury{l] [l}steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good{l] [l}time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.{l]{s]{p]
[p [n}7{] [s [l}We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the{l] [l}bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect{l] [l}on the head?{s] [s}What's that stultifying saying about chowder-{l][l}headed people?{s] [s}[q=i}"But look,
[name=q}Queequeg{name], ain't that a live eel in{l] [l}your bowl?{s] [s}Where's your harpoon?"{s]{p]{page]
[page [n}74{][p [n}1{] [s [l}Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well{l] [l}deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling{l] [l}chowders.{s] [s [l}Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and{l] [l}chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming{l] [l}through your clothes.{s] [s [l}The area before the house was paved {l] [l}with clam-shells.{s] [s}[name=h}Mrs. Hussey{name] wore a polished necklace of{l] [l}codfish vertebra; and [name=hh}Hosea Hussey{name] had his account books{l] [l}bound in superior old shark-skin.{s] [s}There was a fishy flavor to{l] [l}the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morn{l][l}ing happening to take a stroll along the beach among some{l] [l}fishermen's boats, I saw [name=mh}Hosea{name]'s brindled cow feeding on fish{l] [l}remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's{l] [l}decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, [diraddr}I assure ye.{diraddr]{l]{s]{p] 
[p [n}2{][s}[l}Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from{l] [l}[name=h}Mrs. Hussey{name] concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as{l] [l}[name=q}Queequeg{name] was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady{l] [l}reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed{l] [l}no harpoon in her chambers.{s] [q=i}"Why not?"{q] said I; [q=i}"every{l] [l}true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?"{q] [q=h}"Because it's dangerous,"{q] says she.{s] [s}[q=h}"Ever since young Stiggs{l] [l}coming from that [dt=n}unfort'nt v'y'ge{dt] of his, when he was gone{l] [l}four years and a half, with only three barrels of [dt=n}ile{dt], was found{l] [l}dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever{l] [l}since then I allow no boarders to take [dt=i}sich{dt] dangerous [dt=n}weepons{dt]{l] [l}in their rooms at night.{s] [s}So, Mr. [name=q}Queequeg{name]"{q] (for she had learned{l] [l}his name), [q=h}"I will just take this [dt=n}here iron{dt], and keep it for you{l] [l}till morning.{s] [s}But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for{l] [l}breakfast, men?"{q]{s] [s}[q=i}"Both,"{q] says I; [q=i}"and let's have a couple of smoked herring{l] [l}by way of variety."{q]{l]{s]{chapter]{excerpt]
