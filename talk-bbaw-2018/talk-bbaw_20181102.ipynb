The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\"_"

    "Despite the ominous picture that is painted here, humankind has had the desire to \"piece together dissociated knowledge\" for centuries. Around 290 BC, King Ptolemy the first or his son, king Ptolemy the second (the record's not clear on that) charged the founding of a research institute which they called the \"Mouseion\" in honorary mention of the Muses. Part of this research institute was the library of Alexandria, famous to this day, which had for objective to be a \"universal library\": they wanted to \"collect all the books in the world\" and, notably, \"the writings of all men _as far as they were worth any attention_\". As all archival collections, the library of Alexandria was established and created on a number of selection criteria. (We'll get back to that later.)"

But, politics aside, the combination of a vast library collection and an international research center facilitated the production of more knowledge, and led to advances in the fields of natural sciences, geography, mathematics, literature, and philosophy.
