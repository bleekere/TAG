Around 290 BC, King Ptolemy the First (or his son, king Ptolemy the Second; the record's not clear on that) charged the founding of a research institute which they called the \"Mouseion\". Part of this research institute was the library of Alexandria, famous to this day, which had for objective to be a \"universal library\". The goal was to \"collect all the books in the world\" and, notably, \"the writings of all men _as far as they were worth any attention_\"."

But, politics aside, the combination of a vast library collection and an international research center facilitated the production of more knowledge. Scholars from all over the civilised world came to work in the Mouseion. They had considerable academic freedom and made avid use of the libary's collection which resulted in high-end scholarship and led to advances in the fields of natural sciences, geography, mathematics, literature, and philosophy. I think it safe to assume that today's digital libraries and archives still have this noble ambition. "
